# Responding to emergency situations

## Common fatalities
### Boating Immersion and Trauma Deaths
#### Visit https://cdn.redcross.ca/prodmedia/crc/documents/3-3-4_2011_boating_fnl.pdf for more information.
### Relevant Facts:
- About 40% of all drowning deaths in Canada result from boating activities.
- Many victims drowned within swimming distance of a boat, dock, or shore.
- These fatalities are almost always classified as accidents, meaning they were usually preventable.
### Common Traits of Boating Fatalities
#### Based on an 18-year study of over 3,000 boating deaths, the most common types of fatal boating incidents are:
- Capsizing
- Falling overboard
- Swamping
- Collision
#### Main Contributing Factors:
- Not wearing a personal flotation device (PFD) or lifejacket
- Alcohol and drug impairment during boat operation
#### Important Stats:
- Only about 13% of drowning victims were wearing a PFD or lifejacket.
- About 86% of victims were not wearing any flotation device.
- 25% of victims did not even have a PFD onboard.
- 43% of victims died less than 2 metres from shore or safety.
- Alcohol was involved in 40% of preventable boating fatalities.
#### Safety Takeaway:
- The single most important thing to prevent drowning is to always wear a properly adjusted PFD or lifejacket that fits your size and type of activity.
#### Many boaters wrongly believe:
- You don’t need a life preserver if you can swim well.
- Skilled boaters don’t need to wear a life preserver.
- You don’t need a life preserver if you are close to shore.
- Life preservers are only necessary when the boat is moving.
#### These assumptions are all dangerous and can lead to fatalities.

## Distress signals
In a real emergency, knowing how to send or recognize a distress signal can save lives. There may only be one chance to call for help—make it count.

### Recognized Distress Signals (Collision Regulations)
- Continuous sound from foghorn, air horn, whistle, bell, or gunshots at 1-minute intervals.
- Parachute flares.
- Multi-star rockets: two red star flares, the second fired 15 seconds after the first.
- Hand-held red flares.
- Orange smoke signal.
- Slowly and repeatedly raising and lowering arms outstretched sideways (used when help is close; frantic waving is NOT a distress signal).
- Flames onboard.
- Square black flag above or below a black ball (or something resembling a ball).
- Radiotelephone broadcast of “Mayday” (serious life-threatening emergency).
- Radiotelephone broadcast of “Pan-Pan” (urgent but non-life-threatening emergency).
- Morse code SOS (... --- ...) by any signaling method.
- International Code Signal of distress: flags “N” and “C” together.
- Orange material with a black square and black circle (large enough to be seen from air).
- High-intensity white light flashing 50-70 times per minute.
- Signal from Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB).
-  Marker dye discharged onto the water beside your vessel.

### Validity and Storage of Pyrotechnic Signals
- Pyrotechnic distress signals (flares) are valid for four years from the date of manufacture (date stamped on flare).
- Store flares vertically in a cool, dry, secure place (e.g., watertight container), but keep accessible.
- “Secure” means to keep away from children.
- Carry more than one type of pyrotechnic distress signal on board.

### Using Emergency Marine Communications Equipment
- Marine distress and safety communication equipment includes:
  - Marine VHF radios with Digital Selective Calling (DSC) on Channel 70.
  - Marine MF/HF DSC radios.
  - Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs).
  - NAVTEX.
  - Inmarsat.
  - Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).
- The GMDSS quickly relays distress alerts to the Canadian Coast Guard and nearby vessels.
- Recreational vessels are not required to have GMDSS-compatible equipment but it is highly recommended.
- Connecting a GPS to DSC radios ensures automatic location transmission during distress calls.
#### Marine VHF Radios and GPS
- Marine VHF radio is generally the most effective and reliable distress alert method.
- Keep the radio tuned to Channel 16 (emergency channel).
- Know and be prepared to state your location.
- Buy a VHF radio with Digital Selective Calling (DSC) on Channel 70 for automatic distress alerts.
- VHF Channel 16 is for emergency calls only; move conversations to working channels.
- Channel 70 is for DSC digital signals only, no voice.
- Operators of VHF radios must hold a Restricted Operator Certificate - Maritime (ROC-M).
#### Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI)
- Obtain a nine-digit MMSI number for your VHF/DSC radio to maximize DSC features.
- MMSI numbers are free from Industry Canada.
- Call: 1-800-667-3780 or visit http://www.ic.gc.ca

### Levels of Distress When Reporting an Emergency
- Distress: MAYDAY: Grave/imminent danger (e.g., sinking, fire): Use Channel 16; say MAYDAY 3x; give vessel name, location, emergency, help needed
- Urgency: PAN-PAN: Safety concern but no immediate danger (e.g., breakdown): Use Channel 16; say PAN-PAN 3x; provide vessel info and assistance needed
- Safety: SECURITY: Navigation or meteorological warnings	Repeat SECURITY 3x; transmit warning
- Non-urgent: Any channel except 16 or 70: Routine communication, non-emergency: Use other channels; 16 and 70 reserved for emergency

### Cellular Telephones (*16 Service)
- Dial *16 to contact Canadian Coast Guard Rescue Centres.
- Cell phones are not a reliable substitute for marine radios:
  - Limited coverage and can be damaged by moisture.
  - Do not alert nearby vessels.
  - Wireless signals can be hard to trace.
  - Not all providers support *16; check with your carrier.

### Global Positioning System (GPS)
  - GPS provides location anywhere on Earth within ~30 meters (Canadian Differential GPS offers ~10 meters accuracy).
  - Connect GPS to DSC radio for automatic position transmission during distress alerts.
  - Do not rely exclusively on GPS; keep backup navigation aids like marine charts.

### Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB)
- Buoyant radio distress beacon transmitting signals to satellites.
- Activated manually or automatically (if vessel sinks or overturns).
- Transmits for hours, relaying exact location to search and rescue centers.
- Recommended especially for offshore or remote location boating.
- EPIRBs must be registered with the Canadian Beacon Registry:
  - Phone: 1-877-406-7671
  - Email: cbr@sarnet.dnd.ca
  - Website: https://www.cbr-rcb.ca/cbr/presentation/other_autre/index.php

### Using Pyrotechnic Distress Signals (Flares)
- Use only in real emergencies.
- Read manufacturer instructions for safe operation.
- Buy only Transport Canada approved flares.
- Valid for four years; dispose of expired flares via retailer, fire department, or Transport Canada.

### Four Types of Approved Distress Flares
- Parachute Flare: Red star flare propelled by rocket reaching 300 m; burns ~40 seconds, Fire at ≥45° angle into wind; parachute drifts flare over position
- Multi-Star Rocket: Two or more red star flares fired from flare gun; burn ~4-5 seconds, Fire almost straight up; fire two flares within 15 seconds
- Hand-held Flare: Red flame torch; burns ~1 minute, Ignite away from vessel, downwind; do not look directly at flare
- Smoke Flare: Produces dense orange smoke for ~1-3 minutes, Hold aloft or float on water (downwind side); for daytime visibility

### Pyrotechnics Carrying Requirements
- Pleasure craft >6 m (19’8”) must carry pyrotechnic distress signals unless:
  - Operating on rivers, canals, or lakes less than 1 nautical mile (1.85 km) from shore.
  - Engaged in official competitions or preparation with no sleeping quarters.
  
### Legal Duties under Canadian Law
- Under Section 131 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, qualified vessel operators must proceed with all speed to assist on receiving a distress signal and, if possible, confirm receipt.
- If unable or considering it unreasonable to assist, the reason must be logged officially.
- The Criminal Code of Canada requires boaters to assist those in distress without endangering themselves or their vessel.
- False distress signals are an offence; they risk diverting rescue resources.

### Summary
Knowing how to recognize, send, and respond to distress signals is critical for safe boating. Always have proper communication devices aboard, know how to use them, keep safety equipment maintained, and be familiar with legal requirements and best practices.

## Malfunctions
### In the event of a mechanical failure or equipment malfunction, follow these steps:
#### Adjust Your Speed Appropriately
- Slow down or stop if necessary to investigate the issue safely.
- Only maintain headway speed if required to avoid immediate danger (e.g., collisions, grounding).
#### Anchor If Necessary
- If the craft loses power and begins to drift into a hazardous area (e.g., rocks, other vessels, restricted zones), drop anchor to hold your position.
- In high-traffic waterways, paddle to a safe area away from the channel before anchoring or beaching the vessel.
#### Investigate the Problem
- Check for obvious issues with the engine, electrical systems, or controls.
- Refer to the manufacturer’s owner manual or troubleshooting guide to identify common causes.
#### Attempt Repairs if Safe to Do So
- Use your onboard tool kit to fix minor issues if possible.
- Your boat’s tool kit should include:
  - Extra fuses and light bulbs
  - Spare propeller and shear pin
  - Spark plugs and a spark plug wrench
  - Assorted nuts, bolts, and a small wrench set
  - Penetrating oil
  - Duct tape or electrical tape
#### Signal for Help if Needed
- If the problem cannot be resolved and you are in danger or require assistance, use recognized distress signals to alert other boaters or rescue services.
- Examples: Distress flag, sound signaling device, marine VHF radio (Channel 16), flares

##### Regular maintenance of your pleasure craft is essential for safe boating. As the operator, it’s your responsibility to reduce the risk of mechanical failure and ensure that all equipment is functional.

## Maintenance Schedule 
At a minimum, inspect your vessel and safety equipment:
- At the start of each boating season
- Once per month throughout the season
- This includes both the boat’s mechanical systems and all required safety gear.

## Fire
### Responding to Fire On Board
- A fire on board a vessel is a serious emergency. Quick action and calm decision-making are essential to protect everyone’s safety.
#### Step 1: Ensure Everyone Puts On a Flotation Device
- Immediately instruct all passengers to put on a properly fitted personal flotation device (PFD) or lifejacket. This ensures their safety in case the fire spreads or evacuation becomes necessary.
#### Step 2: Fight the Fire (If Safe to Do So)
- Stop the vessel if it’s underway and safe to do so. 
- Turn the boat so the fire is downwind (keep flames and smoke blowing away from you and the passengers). 
- Shut off the engine and fuel supply if possible to help prevent the fire from spreading. 
##### Use your fire extinguisher:
- Read and understand the manufacturer’s instructions before an emergency happens.
- Activate the extinguisher and aim at the base of the flames.
- Sweep side to side at the base of the fire.
- Continue discharging for a few seconds even after the flames are out to prevent re-ignition.
- Note: Fires often reignite if extinguishers are stopped too soon. Always ensure the fire is fully out.

### Know Your Equipment
- Make sure your boat carries the appropriate number and type of portable fire extinguishers as required by Transport Canada.
- Even if your boat is equipped with an automatic fire suppression system (e.g., inboard engine compartments), portable extinguishers are still mandatory.

## Person overboard
- Falling overboard is one of the leading causes of boating fatalities in Canada. Quick, calm, and informed action can make the difference between life and death.
### Emergency Procedure: Person Overboard
- Sound the Alarm
- Shout “Man Overboard!” and alert everyone onboard.
- Slow Down and Stop (If Safe)
- Immediately reduce speed. Stop the engine if possible and safe.
- Throw a buoyant object (life ring, cushion, or fender) toward the person. This helps them float and marks their position if they submerge.
- Assign a Spotter
  - Designate one crew member (not the driver) to keep constant visual contact.
  - They should continuously point toward the person in the water to help guide the operator.
- Maneuver the Vessel
  - Carefully navigate to a position downwind of the victim.
  - Always approach from downwind or into the current if it is stronger and recover the person over the windward side to prevent the boat from drifting over them.
- Use Rescue Equipment
  - Use a lifebuoy, buoyant heaving line, or boat ladder.
  - If a reboarding device is not available, secure both ends of a line to the boat and drape it over the side to serve as a step.
#### Practice & Preparation
- Rehearse man-overboard recovery procedures regularly with your crew.
- Conduct practice drills using a floating object like a stick or lifejacket.
- Practice recovery at night, in rough water, or when visibility is poor.
- Ensure your heaving line is always untangled and ready to throw instantly.
### Key Hazards for a Person Overboard
- Hypothermia (especially in cold Canadian waters)
- Drowning (especially without a PFD)
- Injury from propellers or other boats
- Delayed rescue due to panic, poor visibility, or inexperience
  - The faster the rescue, the greater the chance of survival.
#### Prevention Is Best
##### Avoiding a person-overboard situation is the most effective way to ensure safety. Follow these tips:
- Stay low and centered when moving around — don’t “rock the boat.”
- Never sit or stand on the gunwale or bow while underway.
- Use one hand to work, one hand to hold onto the boat.
- Avoid alcohol while boating — it impairs balance, reflexes, and judgment.
- Go ashore in bad weather — don’t push your equipment or your luck.

## Collisions
- Collisions on the water—whether with submerged objects or other vessels—can quickly become life-threatening. Knowing how to respond can save lives and reduce damage.
### Types of Collisions
#### 1. Submerged Object Collision
If your vessel hits a submerged object:
- Have everyone immediately put on a lifejacket or personal flotation device (PFD).
- Steer toward the nearest safe location at reduced speed.
- Assess your vessel for damage. Check for signs of hull breach or flooding.
#### 2. Vessel-to-Vessel Collision
If you collide with another vessel:
- Ensure all passengers on both vessels put on PFDs right away.
- Assess the damage to both vessels.
- Issue a distress signal if either vessel is in danger of sinking or life is at risk.
- Focus first on stabilizing the less-damaged vessel.
- Then attempt to assist the other vessel as safely as possible.

### Legal Responsibilities
Under Canadian law:
- Criminal Code of Canada: You must render assistance in a vessel collision, especially where human life is in danger.
- Canada Shipping Act, 2001 – Section 451: If you encounter a collision scene, you must assist any person in danger on the water, as long as doing so doesn’t place your own vessel or crew at serious risk.
- Information Exchange: All operators involved in a collision, even if the damage is minor, are legally required to exchange:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Contact information

### Preventing Collisions
The best way to survive a collision is to avoid it altogether. Follow these rules:
- Operate at a Safe Speed: operate at a speed that allows time to avoid hazards or traffic.
- Slow Down in busy areas: Reduced speed gives more time to react to other vessels, swimmers, or unexpected obstacles.
- Watch for Swimmers and Divers: Stay far away from marked swimming and diving zones.
- Maintain an attentive Lookout: Continuously scan your surroundings. Know who’s around, where they’re going, and how fast they’re moving.
- Never consume alcohol: Alcohol impairs reflexes, judgment, balance, and coordination—and is a leading cause of boating accidents.

## Cold water shock and Hypothermia
Cold water shock is one of the most deadly and misunderstood dangers in recreational boating. Sudden immersion in cold water can quickly lead to drowning—even for strong swimmers.
### Cold Water Shock Facts
- An average of 149 people die each year in Canada from cold water immersion (Transport Canada).
- 60% of drowning deaths in 2004 occurred in water colder than 10°C.
- Most victims were not wearing a flotation device.
- Many drown within swimming distance of safety.
### What Is Cold Water Shock?
- Cold water shock is the body’s automatic reaction to sudden immersion in water colder than 15°C. It has two dangerous stages:
#### 1. Initial Shock (0–1 Minute)
- Involuntary gasping
- Hyperventilation
- Spike in heart rate and blood pressure
- Muscle paralysis (you may not be able to swim)
#### 2. Cold Incapacitation (1–10 Minutes)
- Loss of muscle control in arms and legs
- Inability to swim or self-rescue
- High risk of drowning without a flotation device
- Important: If you are not wearing a PFD when you enter cold water, your chance of survival drops dramatically.
#### Prevention Is Critical
To reduce your risk of cold water shock:
- Always wear a Transport Canada–approved lifejacket or PFD.
- Avoid overloading your boat.
- Stay ashore in bad weather (high winds, large waves).
- Keep your balance and avoid sudden movements on deck.
- Wearing a flotation device is the single most effective way to survive cold water shock. It keeps you afloat while you regain control of your breathing.
#### Recognizing and Treating Cold Water Shock
##### If a person is immersed in cold water:
- Keep them calm and afloat (preferably with a PFD).
- Focus on helping them control breathing during the first minute.
- Get them out of the water as soon as possible.
##### Once out of the water (mild hypothermia treatment):
- Give warm fluids with sugar (not alcohol or tobacco).
- Apply external warmth to chest and underarms.
- Keep them dry and insulated.
- Do not give a hot shower or bath.
- Only allow light movement (like walking) after 30 minutes of stable recovery.
### Hypothermia
Hypothermia is a potentially fatal condition caused by a drop in core body temperature below 37°C (98.6°F), often following cold water immersion or prolonged exposure to cold, wet, or windy conditions.
#### Stages and Symptoms of Hypothermia
- Early Stage: Shivering, slurred speech, withdrawn behavior
- Intermediate: Slow/weak pulse, shallow breathing, confusion, poor coordination, no shivering
- Final Stage: Unconsciousness, very weak or absent pulse and respiration
#### Preventing Hypothermia
To delay or prevent hypothermia:
- Always wear a PFD or lifejacket (helps insulate and keeps you afloat).
- Dress in layers with windproof and waterproof outerwear.
- Avoid overloading your boat and stay off the water in bad weather.
- Stay still in the water to conserve energy and heat.
- Climb onto a floating object to reduce immersion.
- If alone, cross arms tightly on chest and cross legs and draw up knees
- If in a group, gather close, wrap arms and legs together to conserve body heat
#### Treatment for Mild (Early-Stage) Hypothermia
- Remove victim from cold exposure (e.g., out of water).
- Shelter in a warm, dry place (tent, cabin, etc.).
- Gradually rewarm the person:
  - Replace wet clothes with dry, warm ones.
  - Use blankets, dry coverings, sleeping bags.
  - Cover head and neck.
  - Apply warm (not hot) dry compresses (40–45°C) to chest and underarms.
  - Use body heat if no other heat source is available.
  - Offer warm drinks with sugar (milk, water, juice) — only if the person is alert and able to swallow.
  - No alcohol or caffeine.
  - Do NOT rub the body or extremities.
  - Do NOT place the person in a hot shower or bath.
  - Signal for help using emergency equipment (whistle, flares, radio).
#### Treatment for Moderate to Severe Hypothermia
This is a medical emergency. Take these steps while waiting for professional help:
- Handle gently — avoid rough movement or vibration.
- Extract from water horizontally — do not let the person stand or sit.
- Cut off wet clothing if necessary — don’t tug or twist limbs.
- Lay flat, insulate from cold ground with blankets or sleeping bags.
- Do not feed or give fluids, and do not attempt to rewarm with exercise.
- Continue gentle external warming only (as in mild hypothermia).
- Monitor vital signs: temperature, pulse, respiration, consciousness.
#### After-drop: Even after rescue, cold blood from limbs can lower core temperature further as it returns to the heart. This is why victims must remain still and be warmed gradually.

#### Reminder: Always carry an onboard emergency kit with:
- Flashlight
- Whistle
- First aid kit
- Knife
- Emergency food and water
- Blankets or dry clothing
- Distress signals (flares, mirror)

## Heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and seasickness

### Heat Stroke – Medical Emergency
#### Cause: Prolonged exposure to extreme heat/humidity overwhelms the body’s cooling systems.
- Symptoms:
- High body temperature (often above 40°C / 104°F)
- No sweating
- Flushed, hot dry skin
- Rapid pulse and breathing
- Confusion, hallucinations, strange behavior
- Agitation or disorientation
#### Treatment:
- Call emergency services immediately.
- Move the person to a cool, shaded environment.
- If conscious, place them in a cool (not cold) bath or sponge their skin with lukewarm water and fan gently.
- Offer cool fluids (water, sports drinks) only if the person is alert and able to swallow.
- Monitor for signs of collapse or unconsciousness.

### Heat Exhaustion – Non-Emergency, But Serious
#### Cause: Loss of body fluids and salts through sweating, leading to inability to cool down.
- Symptoms:
- Headache
- Muscle cramps
- Dizziness or fainting
- Cool, moist skin
- Fast, weak pulse
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Nausea
#### Treatment:
- Rest in a cool, shaded area.
- Drink cool water or electrolyte-rich fluids (sports drinks).
- Eat salty snacks, if tolerated.
- Loosen or remove tight clothing.
- Cool the skin with damp cloth or a mist of water.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine.

### Seasickness – Common Boating Ailment
#### Cause: Conflict between visual signals and inner ear balance (motion sensing) — sensory mismatch.
#### Symptoms:
- Mild nausea → sweating → upset stomach
- Vomiting (in moderate to severe cases)
#### Treatment & Prevention:
- Use Scopolamine patches (transdermal), if not operating the vessel (can cause drowsiness).
- Stay above deck, focus on the horizon.
- Keep fresh air circulating.
- Avoid heavy or greasy foods before and during boating.
- Sit midship, where movement is least pronounced.

## Flooding, capsizing, swamping, sinking, and grounding
### Flooding: What Can Cause a Hull Leak?
- Striking submerged objects (rocks, logs, etc.)
- Hull cracks or punctures
- Failed gaskets on through-hull fittings or other hardware
#### Step-by-Step Response:
- Stop the Boat
- Bring the craft to a complete stop to reduce water pressure against the hull and slow water intake.
- Start Bailing Water
##### Begin removing water using:
- A manual bailer
- A manual pump
- An electric bilge pump (if available and working)
##### Locate the Leak
- While bailing, inspect for:
- Obvious holes or cracks
- Failed fittings or seals
##### Try to Plug the Leak
- Use any available materials to slow or stop water ingress:
- Soft wooden plugs (e.g. tapered emergency plugs)
- Rags, towels, foam, sponges
- Duct tape in less extreme situations
##### Signal for Help
- If the situation is beyond your control, use distress signals (see Section 7.11) to call for assistance.

#### Bilge Pumps (Larger Craft)
- Vessels 14+ metres in length typically rely on built-in bilge pumps.
- Manual bailers/pumps are still required by law as a backup.
- Ensure bilge spaces are accessible by manual pumps in case of system failure.

#### Prevention Tips:
- Inspect through-hull fittings and gaskets pre-season and monthly.
- Carry soft plugs and leak repair gear in your emergency kit.
- Make sure your bilge pump system is functioning and batteries are charged.

### Swamping and sinking
#### When your vessel runs aground, capsizes, swamps, or sinks:
- Determine if there is immediate danger to the vessel or people on board.
#### Emergency Response Actions
- Ensure Everyone is Wearing a PFD or Lifejacket: This is always your top priority. Put them on immediately.
- Stay with the Vessel (when appropriate): Most small pleasure craft are designed not to sink, even when swamped.
- Climb onto the overturned hull or remain near the floating debris to stay visible and conserve body heat.
- Check for Passengers: Make sure everyone is accounted for and safe.
- Signal for Help: Use distress signals to call for assistance.

### If Your Boat Capsizes
- Climb onto the hull if it's floating.
- Do NOT try to swim to shore, even if it looks close—it is usually farther than it appears.
- Stay calm and conserve energy.

#### Abandoning Ship
##### When There’s No Time: Jump immediately (e.g. in case of fire or rapid sinking).
- Jump feet first, legs together, mouth closed.
- Jump from the windward side so the vessel drifts away from you.
##### When You Have Some Time:
- Ensure everyone puts on a PFD.
- Call for help using a marine radio or mobile phone if available.
- Signal for help (flares, horn, mirror, etc.).
- Launch a raft or dinghy if equipped.

#### Why Stay With the Boat?
- The hull is easier to spot by rescuers than a person.
- Being out of the water can double your survival time in cold conditions.

### Prevention of Capsizing or Swamping
#### To avoid these emergencies:
- Follow your vessel’s compliance notice
- Never exceed the recommended passenger or weight limits
- Do not use a motor too powerful for the vessel
- Distribute weight evenly
- Keep gear low and secured
- Avoid overloading one side of the boat
- Keep your center of gravity low
- Sit down when moving around
- Lash gear or stow it properly
- Avoid boating in bad weather
- Stay off the water in strong winds, storms, or heavy waves

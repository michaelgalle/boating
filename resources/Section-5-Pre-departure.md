## Load capacity and distribution
To ensure safe operation and avoid accidents, the operator of a pleasure craft must carefully consider the loading and boarding procedures. Overloading, improper distribution of weight, or boarding improperly can increase the risk of injury or loss of life. Here are important guidelines to follow:

### 1. Proper Loading Practices
- Do not overload the craft: Ensure that the total weight, including passengers and gear, does not exceed the vessel’s recommended safe load capacity or the maximum allowable number of adult persons.
- Distribute weight evenly: Position people and gear on board so that the weight is evenly distributed, ensuring stability.
- Keep the center of gravity low: Place heavier items in the lowest possible positions, ideally close to the boat's centerline, to improve stability.
- Secure gear: Lash down gear or stow it in lockers or under seats to prevent it from shifting. Unsecured items can become dangerous projectiles in rough conditions.

### 2. Compliance with Vessel’s Loading Limits
- Always adhere to the loading limits outlined on the Compliance Notice of your vessel. These limits are designed for fair weather conditions.
- In adverse weather conditions (such as strong winds and large waves), the vessel’s carrying capacity is reduced. Do not exceed the limits, even in calm weather.
- Overpowered or overloaded vessels are at greater risk of swamping and sinking. Such vessels sit lower in the water, which compromises buoyancy and stability.

### 3. The Dangers of Overloading or Overpowering
- Overloading: A vessel that is overloaded is less stable and more prone to capsizing, especially if the center of gravity is too high.
- Overpowering: A vessel with too large an outboard motor will handle poorly and could be harder to control, increasing the risk of accidents.
- Always respect the limitations of your vessel—both in terms of weight and engine power.

### 4. Proper Gear and Cargo Handling
- Keep the center of gravity low: This is your primary consideration for stability. Make sure heavy or bulky items are stored low in the vessel.
- Avoid bulky items on board: When loading a boat, avoid carrying heavy or bulky items in your arms, as it will obstruct your view and make balancing difficult.
- Stow items properly: Gear should be stowed securely and out of the way to prevent creating tripping hazards.
- Ensure safety gear is accessible: Life jackets, fire extinguishers, and other safety equipment should be stored where they are easy to access but not in the way of movement.

### 5. Safe Boarding Practices
- Secure the vessel: Ensure the vessel is tied up or firmly held in place before anyone boards.
- Use solid handholds: When boarding, always grab something solid like the gunwale or a stanchion to steady yourself.
- Boarding small or unstable vessels:
  - Crouch low to maintain your center of gravity and avoid tipping.
  - Board near the bow and then move to your seat along the centerline of the hull.
  - Never step on the gunwale, as this can cause the boat to capsize.
- Distribute weight once onboard: Ensure all gear is balanced and stowed properly once everyone is on board. This is critical for maintaining the vessel's stability.

### 6. Additional Tips for Loading and Boarding
- Load from the shore or dock: The safest way to load bulky or heavy items is to do so from the shore or a dock, not from a moving vessel.
- Set up the gear before boarding: Place the gear where you can easily reach it once onboard or have someone hand it to you once you are safely in the boat.

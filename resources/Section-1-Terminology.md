# Registration, Foreign residents, licensing, general terminology

## Registration

Registration is the formal process through which a vessel is officially recorded with the Government of Canada. This applies to commercial vessels and larger pleasure craft.

#### Who Needs to Register a Vessel?
- Commercial vessels: All commercial vessels over 15 gross tons must be registered.
- Pleasure craft: Pleasure craft over 15 tons (if used for non-commercial purposes) must also be registered.
- Pleasure craft under 15 tons: These boats do not need to be registered; instead, they are licensed (described below).
##### Registration Process:
- Step 1: Complete the Form 1 (Registration of a Vessel) for Transport Canada.
- Step 2: Submit the form with supporting documents (proof of ownership, proof of origin, etc.).
- Step 3: Pay registration fees (varies depending on vessel type).
- Step 4: Upon approval, you’ll receive a registration number that must be displayed above the waterline in letters and numbers at least 10 cm in height on both the bow and stern. Inside the hull the registration number and tonnage must be visible. The stern must have both the name and port of registry displayed. 

Registration is valid for 5 years.
The Hull Identification Number (HIN) is required for registration purposes.

## Foreign Residents

#### Boating Requirements for Foreign Residents:
- PCOC Requirement: Foreign residents must still obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) or other proof of competency if they want to operate a motorized vessel in Canadian waters for more than 45 days or that is licensed in Canada.
- Boat Registration: Foreign boaters can register their vessels in Canada, especially if they plan to use them in Canadian waters for extended periods.
- Temporary registration is available for up to 12 months.

#### Boating Safety Laws: Foreign boaters must follow Canadian boating laws, including:
- Speed limits
- Restricted zones
- Required safety equipment (e.g., life jackets, fire extinguishers).
- Foreign Boating License (PCOC):
- Foreign residents can take an approved Canadian boating safety course and pass the test to obtain a PCOC.
- If you’re visiting Canada and operating a vessel temporarily, your home country’s boating certification might be valid (check with Transport Canada for reciprocity).
- Insurance: While not mandatory, it's highly recommended that foreign residents carry boating insurance when operating in Canada.
- Licensing (PCOC)

#### What is Licensing?
- Licensing is the process that applies to pleasure craft that are under 15 gross tons. These vessels do not need full registration and can instead be licensed with Transport Canada.
Who Needs a PCOC?
Motorized pleasure craft operators: All operators of motorized boats in Canadian waters must have a PCOC.
This includes motorized boats, jet skis, personal watercraft, and similar vessels.
Exceptions:
Operators under 16: Operators who are under 16 years old can operate vessels with motors under 10 horsepower without a PCOC.
Non-motorized vessels (e.g., canoes, kayaks) do not require a PCOC.

#### Obtaining a PCOC:
Complete an approved boating safety course (online or in-person).
Pass a multiple-choice exam on topics like boating safety, navigation rules, equipment requirements, and emergency procedures.
Receive your PCOC: Once you pass the exam, you receive a card that is valid for life.
The PCOC is typically mailed to you (physical card or digital certificate).

## General Terminology

Below are key terms you will need to understand for the PCOC exam and boating in Canada:

#### Common Terms:

- Pleasure Craft: Any vessel used for recreational purposes. This includes powerboats, jet skis, personal watercraft (PWC), sailboats, etc.
- Vessel: A watercraft used for navigation or transportation on water, including pleasure craft, commercial vessels, etc.
- Operator: The person who is driving or controlling the vessel. This person is responsible for the safe operation of the boat.
- Hull Identification Number (HIN): A unique identification number assigned to each vessel at the time of manufacturing, similar to a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
- Hull serial number: Must be displayed on the hull, and each character must be at least 3.2 cm in height and width. Used by police to recover stolen vessels. According to the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, no person shall alter, deface or remove a hull serial number.
- Commercial vessel: any vessel that is used to generate income 
- Power-driven vessel: Uses machinery to operate and move. Requires a PCOC to operate power-driven pleasure craft.
- Sail driven vessel: Any vessel that is not using machinery to be propelled and is under sail. PCOC must be brought on board if the vessel is fitted with a motor, regardless of whether or not it is being used.
- PCOC: Pleasure Craft Operator Card—a boating license that proves the operator has completed a boating safety course and passed a test.
- Registration Number: The unique number assigned to registered vessels by Transport Canada.
- Licensing: The process that applies to pleasure craft under 15 gross tons. Instead of full registration, a licensing system allows the vessel to be identified.
- Right of Way: The boating rule that determines which vessel has the priority when vessels are approaching one another.
- Distress Signals: Methods used to signal for help in emergency situations (e.g., flares, horns, whistles).
- Lifejacket (Personal Flotation Device - PFD): A required safety device that must be worn by every person on board a vessel, unless certain exceptions apply.
- Restricted Zones: Areas where boating is either restricted or prohibited. These zones may include:
  -  No-wake zones
  -  Wildlife protection areas
  -  Docks and marinas
- Boating Safety Equipment: Essential gear for safe boating, including:
  - Life jackets
  - Flares
  - Fire extinguishers
  - Throwable devices
  - First-aid kits

## Vessel terminology 

#### Vessel
- Definition: A vessel is any boat, ship, or craft that is designed, used, or capable of being used for navigation on, in, or through water. This includes vessels powered by various methods of propulsion, whether mechanical (e.g., engine), human-powered (e.g., oars), or sail-powered.
- Legal Reference: Canada Shipping Act, 2001.

#### Hull
- Definition: The hull is the main body of the vessel, running from the deck down to the bottom of the vessel. It is the outer shell and does not include components like equipment, fittings, motors, cabins, or bilges.
- Important: The hull provides the structural integrity and flotation for the vessel.

#### Bow
- Definition: The bow is the front end of a vessel. It is the part that typically faces forward while the boat is in motion.
- Key Feature: The bow is usually pointed or tapered to minimize resistance in the water.

#### Stern
- Definition: The stern is the back end or aft portion of a vessel. It is the opposite of the bow and is where the propulsion system (e.g., engine or motor) is typically located.
- Key Feature: The stern is the last part of the vessel to pass through the water.

#### Beam
- Definition: The beam is the width of the vessel, measured at its widest point. This point is typically located at the midpoint between the bow and stern.
- Key Feature: The beam impacts how stable the vessel is in the water, with wider vessels generally being more stable.

#### Draft
- Definition: The draft is the minimum depth of water required for a vessel to float freely without hitting the bottom. It’s measured from the water surface to the lowest point of the hull.
- Key Note: On boats with outboard motors, the draft is measured from the water surface to the lowest part of the motor (skeg).
- Why it matters: Understanding your boat’s draft is crucial for navigating shallow waters and referring to marine charts to identify navigable areas.

#### Freeboard
Definition: The freeboard is the vertical distance from the lowest point of a vessel’s deck to the surface of the water.
Key Feature: A vessel with high freeboard is more difficult to re-board from the water without additional equipment, like ladders or platforms.
Safety Consideration: Vessels with higher freeboard are typically more stable and safer in rough waters.

#### Gunwale
- Definition: The gunwale (pronounced “gunnel”) is the top edge of a vessel’s hull, where the hull meets the deck.
- Key Feature: The gunwale is a strong part of the vessel's structure, providing support for the sides and deck.

#### Length Overall (LOA)
- Definition: The Length Overall (LOA) is the distance from the foremost point of the vessel’s hull (either above or below the waterline) to the aft-most point.
- Key Feature: LOA is used in regulations to define the size of a vessel for various legal and safety requirements.
- Important: LOA can differ from length at the waterline, as the latter does not include overhanging parts of the hull.

#### Waterline (Design)
- Definition: The design waterline is the line that indicates where the surface of the water meets the hull when the vessel is afloat, carrying a normal load and on an even keel (balanced and upright).Key Feature: The design waterline is typically marked on the hull with a horizontal line and is important for stability and buoyancy.

## Directions

#### Port Side
- Definition: The port side is the left side of the vessel when you are facing forward, in the direction the vessel is moving.
- Key Feature: Port and left are easy to remember because both have four letters.

#### Starboard Side
- Definition: The starboard side is the right side of the vessel when facing forward.
- Key Feature: Starboard and right both have a larger number of letters (9 vs. 4), which can help remember this term.

#### Ahead
Definition: Ahead refers to a direction that is directly in front of the vessel.
Key Feature: Anything that is in front of you as the operator, whether you’re moving or stationary, is considered ahead.

#### Abaft
- Definition: Abaft refers to something that is behind something else. If an object is behind the port beam, it is said to be “abaft the port beam”.
- Example: "Abaft the port beam" refers to the space behind the middle of the vessel on the port side.

#### Aft
- Definition: Aft means moving or directing toward the stern of the vessel. It's a general term indicating behind or towards the back of the vessel.
- Note: If you are walking towards the stern, you are going aft.

#### Abeam
- Definition: Abeam means directly perpendicular to the vessel. It refers to a direction straight out from the vessel's middle, either on the port or starboard side.
- Example: If you are facing forward, an object that is directly on the left or right side of the vessel at the midpoint is referred to as "on the port beam" or "on the starboard beam".

#### Astern
- Definition: Astern means directly behind the vessel. The term dead astern refers to being exactly behind the vessel.
- Example: When backing up the boat, the direction you're moving is astern.

## Nautical terminology

#### Operate
- Definition: The action of controlling the speed and course of a pleasure craft. It involves steering the vessel and adjusting its speed

#### Operator
- Definition: The operator is the person in command of the vessel. Even if you borrow a boat, you are considered the operator when you’re behind the wheel, controlling the vessel.
- Legal Responsibility: Under Canadian regulations, the operator is responsible for the boat's condition, operation, and the safety of everyone on board.

#### Aids to Navigation
- Definition: External systems, structures, or devices that help the operator in navigation by providing information about safe routes, obstacles, or potential dangers.
- Examples: Buoys, day beacons, and lighthouses are common examples of aids to navigation.

#### Navigational Aids
- Definition: Shipboard tools or devices that assist in determining your position and navigating your course.
- Examples: Radar, sonar, GPS, compass, sextant, and marine charts are all navigational aids.

#### Wash
- Definition: The loose or broken water left behind by a vessel as it moves through the water. It includes the water churned up by the propeller (propeller wash).
- Important Note: Even when a boat is stationary or idling, it can still create wash.

#### Wake
- Definition: The disturbed water and waves created behind a vessel as it moves through the water. A vessel must be in motion to produce a wake.
- Responsibility: The operator is responsible for the wake they create, as large wakes can damage property. Always try to minimize your wake, especially near docks or other vessels.

#### Fenders
- Definition: Devices (often made of plastic) that are hung from the side of a vessel to protect it from damage when rubbing against docks or other boats.
- Important: Fenders absorb the impact and prevent scratches or dents to the hull of the boat.

#### Seaworthy
- Definition: A vessel is considered seaworthy if:
  - The hull is undamaged and appropriate for the sea conditions.
  - The engine size is within safe limits for the vessel.
  - The vessel is not overloaded.
  - All equipment is in good working order.
- Legal Note: Operating a vessel that is not seaworthy (e.g., overloaded or with an oversized engine) is considered a criminal offence.

#### Underway
- Definition: A vessel is considered underway if it is afloat and free to move. It is not at anchor, not tied to a dock, and not on shore.

#### Windward
- Definition: The direction upwind, or the direction from which the wind is blowing.
- Windward Side of an Island: The side of the island that faces the wind.
- Windward Side of a Sailboat: The side opposite the mainsail; this side is into the wind.

#### Leeward
- Definition: The direction downwind, or away from the wind. It is the sheltered side where the wind is not blowing.
- Leeward Side of an Island: The side of the island that is sheltered from the wind.
- Leeward Side of a Sailboat: The side that is behind the mainsail, opposite the windward side.

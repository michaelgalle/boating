# Collision Regulations (Rules of the Road)
When navigating on water, it's essential to understand the Collision Regulations (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._1416/), which are similar to road rules for cars. These regulations determine who has the right of way when two vessels cross paths.

## Crossing Courses:
- When two vessels are on a crossing course, the "stand-on vessel" (the vessel with the right of way) maintains its course and speed, but with caution.
- The "give-way vessel" must take early, clear, and substantial action to avoid collision by changing speed or course.
- The stand-on vessel has the right of way and should not change course unless necessary.
- The give-way vessel must take action to avoid collision, ensuring it passes well behind the stand-on vessel.
These regulations apply to all vessels, from small pleasure craft to large freighters, on any navigable Canadian waterway.
#### Penalties for Non-Compliance:
- Failure to follow the Collision Regulations can lead to fines, imprisonment, or both.
## Vessel Sectors:
Think of the area around a vessel as divided into three sectors:
- Port Sector (left side)
- Starboard Sector (right side)
- Stern Sector (behind the vessel)
These sectors help determine which vessel has the right of way in different situations. The goal of these rules is to prevent collisions and ensure safe navigation on the water.
## Right of way 
#### Power-driven vessel meets power-driven vessel: 
- If a power driven vessel crosses your path and approaches from your port side, you have right of way and are the stand-on vessel. 
- If another power-driven vessel approaches from your starboard side, then you are the give-way vessel (must take early and obvious action to avoid a collision). 
- If a power-driven vessel approaches from your stern, then you have the right of way and should take caution while continuing your course. 
- If a power driven vessel approaches directly in front of you, you should send a sound signal of 1 short blast, lasting approximately 1 second (which communicates that you are altering your course starboard, leaving the other vessel on your port side) and alter your course starboard.
- When overtaking and approaching another power driven vessel from their stern, you must adjust your speed to decrease the magnitude of your wake and avoid capsizing a smaller vessel. 

#### Sail-driven vessel meets sail-driven vessel:
- Windward Side Definition: The windward side of a sail-driven vessel is opposite the side where the main sail is set, the side where the wind is coming from. For example, if the sail is set on the starboard side, the port side is the windward side.
#### Crossing Situations:
##### Vessel A (Port Windward) vs Vessel B (Starboard Windward):
- The vessel with starboard windward has the right of way (stand-on vessel).
##### Both Vessels Have the Same Windward Side:
- If both vessels have the same windward side, the vessel that is upwind (windward) must take action to keep well clear of the downwind (leeward) vessel.
- Example: If Vessel A and Vessel B both have starboard as their windward side, but Vessel A is downwind, Vessel A is the give-way vessel.
##### Uncertainty About Windward Side:
- If the downwind vessel is unsure whether the upwind vessel has the wind on its port or starboard side, the downwind vessel (with wind on its port side) must take early and substantial action to keep well clear of the upwind vessel.

In crossing situations, the give-way vessel must stay well clear of the stand-on vessel, taking early, obvious and substantial action to avoid a collision.

##### Right of way is always given to the vessel that is less manoeuvrable. (if a vessel is manoeuvrable, its ability to alter its course and speed is not impaired)
#### In short, 
- Power driven vessels must give way to sail-driven vessels, vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre and vessels engaged in fishing with nets or trawls
- Sail driven vessels must give way to vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre and vessels fishing with nets or trawls
- Vessels engaged in fishing must give way to vessels not under command and vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre.

#### In narrow channels: 
- Smaller vessels must give way to a vessel that is large and has difficulty manoeuvring
- If there are dangerous currents, the down-river going vessel has right of way.
- A vessel travelling through a narrow fairway/channel must stay as close to the edge of the channel/fairway on its starboard side as it can whilst travelling safely. 

#### Navigating in or near Commercial Shipping Channels
- When operating near commercial shipping channels or inshore traffic zones, smaller vessels and fishing boats should take extra caution. These areas are primarily used by larger, less maneuverable ships, so safety measures are crucial.
- Always follow right-of-way rules and keep a safe distance from larger vessels.
- Do not obstruct the shipping channel or moor to navigational buoys.
- Ensure you are visible to larger vessels. Consider using a radar reflector to help larger ships detect your presence on their radar screens.
- Carry marine charts for the area you are navigating to ensure you are aware of the shipping lanes and any potential hazards.
- If possible, navigate with other small boats to make your group more visible to larger vessels.
- Vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft.) in length must give way to vessels that can only safely navigate in a narrow channel or are following a traffic lane, regardless of course.
- Always keep clear of docked ferries, ferries in transit, and vessels being towed. Ferries often use a prolonged horn blast (4-6 seconds) when leaving the dock.
- Ferries may be anchored by cables, which could be submerged. Be cautious when crossing between a ferry and its dock to avoid hitting these cables, which could disable your motor or trap your boat.
#### Rules of the Collision Regulations:
- Rule 10: Always yield to any vessel whose maneuverability is restricted due to its draft.
- Rule 16: If directed by a larger vessel to give way (typically signaled by five short-blast sounds), always do so.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure safety for both yourself and larger vessels in busy commercial zones. Always remain alert, and remember that small vessels are expected to prioritize safety and yield to more constrained, larger ships.

## Sound signals for collision avoidance
When to Use Sound Signals: In areas with limited visibility, such as fog, a combination of long and short blasts on a sound signaling device is required to alert other vessels to your presence.
- Proceed at a safe speed while sounding these signals to ensure you're heard.
##### Departing a Dock:
To signal your departure from a dock, sound one prolonged blast on your sound signaling device (e.g., horn).
##### Maneuvering Signals:
- One short blast: "I am altering course to starboard."
- Two short blasts: "I am altering course to port."
- Three short blasts: "I am moving backwards (using astern propulsion)."
- Four short blasts: "I am unable to maneuver."
- Five short blasts: Used when the vessel operator doesn’t understand the intentions of another vessel.
##### Sound Signaling Device Requirements:
- Vessels 12 metres (39 ft.) or more must have at least a whistle.
- Vessels 20 metres (65.6 ft.) or more must have both a whistle and a bell.
##### The sound signaling device must have an audible range of:
- 1.5 nautical miles for vessels under 20 meters.
- 1.0 nautical miles for vessels 20-75 meters.
- Capable of producing a prolonged blast (4-6 seconds).
##### Vessels Less Than 12 Metres:
- Can use hand-, mouth-, or power-operated sound signaling devices as long as they produce an efficient sound and can make a 4-6 second blast audible over 0.5 nautical miles.
#### Regulations:
- Sound signals are not just important for communication but also required by law in specific situations like crossing paths with other vessels or operating in fog or mist.
- Non-compliance with sound signaling regulations can increase the risk of accidents and penalties.

## Navigation lights

# Age restrictions, activity restrictions, horsepower restrictions and noise restrictions
(http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2008-120/)
##### The Vessel Operation Restriction Regulations (VORRs) regulate the operation of small vessels on specific bodies of water in Canada. These regulations are essential for ensuring safety, protecting the environment, and reducing conflicts between different types of watercraft.
#### Key Aspects of the Vessel Operation Restriction Regulations:
## Age and Horsepower Restrictions:
- Children under 12 years old can operate powered vessels with motors up to 10 hp (7.5 kW) without adult supervision.
- Persons between 12 and 16 years old can operate powered vessels with motors up to 40 hp (30 kW) without adult supervision.
- No one under 16 years old is allowed to operate a personal watercraft (PWC).
- Persons 16 years or older: No restrictions on motor horsepower but proof of competency is still required for all motorized vessels.
## Restrictions on Activities:
- Boating activities like water-skiing may be restricted to specific areas or times of day, as indicated by posted restrictions.
- Operators must be aware of local boating restrictions, which can include speed limits, activity restrictions, and noise regulations. Ignorance of these restrictions is not an acceptable defense for violating the rules.
- Operators should always check for signage and ensure they comply with all local boating regulations.
#### Signage and Restrictions:
- Vessel Operation Restriction Signs are used to communicate these limits.
- Orange borders indicate general restrictions.
- Green borders indicate specific time-related conditions.
- Red borders mark prohibited periods, while green marks permissible times for activities.
- Arrow-shaped borders indicate directional restrictions.
#### Examples of VORRs signage include:
- No internal combustion or steam engines allowed.
- Speed limits: The speed limit is often given in km/h (e.g., 5, 10, 25, 40, or 55 km/h).
- No water skiing in certain areas or directions.
- No power vessels allowed in the direction indicated by the arrow.
#### Universal Shoreline Speed Limit:
- The 10 km/h speed limit is enforced within 30 meters of the shoreline in many parts of Canada, including provinces such as British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.
##### Exceptions to this include:
- Water skiing where the towboat operates perpendicular to the shoreline.
- Areas where buoys indicate a different speed limit.
- Rivers and canals narrower than 100 meters.
## Noise Restrictions:
- Motorized pleasure craft with non-stock (modified) outboard engines must have a muffler in place and use it when operating within 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) of the shore.
##### Exemptions:
- Vessels built before January 1, 1960.
- Vessels involved in official competitions or training for competitions.

## Responsibilities for Boaters:
- Compliance: All operators must familiarize themselves with local vessel restrictions, including speed limits, activities permitted, and noise regulations.
- Operator Accountability: It is the operator's responsibility to ensure they are aware of all local restrictions and not just rely on posted signs or markers.
- Safety and Environment: These regulations are designed to ensure the safety of all water users, prevent accidents, and reduce the impact on local ecosystems.
- Failure to comply can result in substantial fines.


# Canadian marine charts
#### Graphic Representation:
- Marine charts visually depict important waterway data including depths, submerged hazards, and navigational aids (like buoys, beacons, and lights).
- The charts will also provide details on traffic routes, which help vessels avoid collisions or unsafe areas.
- Chart #1 of a chart set contains definitions of symbols, abbreviations, acronyms, and explanations for terms used in the charts. It is a key reference to understand the specific markings and data on the other charts in the set.
- The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), a division of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, publishes marine charts in Canada. These charts are essential for safe navigation in Canadian waters and are available at CHS website.
- Topographic maps and GPS devices can also supplement marine charts by providing useful geographic data.

##### Operators of vessels are required to have the most recent version of the largest scale chart, documents and publications for every area they navigate, according to the Charts and Nautical Publications Regulations (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-95-149/)
#### Exceptions for Smaller Vessels:
The master and owner of vessels under 100 tons are exempt from having to carry all charts and documents, provided the person in charge of navigation has sufficient knowledge to navigate safely. This knowledge includes:
- The location and character of charted shipping routes.
- The location of lights, buoys, beacons, and other navigational marks.
- An understanding of navigational hazards in the area.
- Awareness of prevailing tides, currents, ice, and weather patterns.

#### Canadian Tide and Current Tables:
- If navigating in areas influenced by tides, it’s recommended to have a copy of the Canadian Tide and Current Tables on board. These tables predict:
- The times of slack water (when there is little or no movement in the water).
- Times and rates of maximum flood and ebb streams (high and low tides).
- The direction of water flow.

# Canada’s criminal code & enforcement
##### The Criminal Code of Canada holds operators accountable for unsafe or illegal vessel operations. Violations can result in serious consequences, including fines, imprisonment, or both. The following sections outline key offenses related to operating pleasure crafts in Canada:

## Key Offenses Under the Criminal Code of Canada:
1. Dangerous Operation (Section 249(1)(b)):
- Offense: Operating a pleasure craft in a way that is dangerous to public safety.
- Examples:
  - Operating too close to other vessels.
  - Driving at excessively high speeds.
  - Disturbing swimmers with wake.
  - Failing to reduce speed in low-visibility conditions (e.g., fog).
2. Spotter Requirement (Section 250(1)):
  - Offense: Operating a vessel towing a person without having a designated spotter.
  - Requirement: The spotter must be facing aft (towards the person being towed), keeping a watchful eye, and communicating with the operator.
    - Note: A rear-view mirror does not meet this requirement.
3. Towing After Dark (Section 250(2)):
- Offense: Towing a person after sunset or before sunrise.
- Reason: It is hazardous because the towed person may not be visible to other vessels.
4. Unseaworthy Vessel (Section 251(1)):
- Offense: Operating a vessel that is unseaworthy.
- Definition of Seaworthy:
  - Hull is undamaged and suitable for current sea conditions.
  - Engine meets compliance standards.
  - Vessel is not overloaded, and the equipment is functional.
5. Duty to Assist (Section 252):
- Offense: Failing to provide assistance in the event of a collision or accident.
- Requirement: Operators involved in an accident must stop, exchange names and addresses, and offer assistance to those in need.
- Additional Requirement (Section 451, Canada Shipping Act 2001): The operator must assist any person in danger on Canadian waters, as long as it doesn't endanger the vessel and passengers.
6. Impaired Operation (Section 253(a) and 253(b)):
- Offense: Operating a vessel under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
- Legal Limit: A blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above 0.08% is a criminal offense, and 0.05% or higher may be considered an offense in some provinces.
- Impairment: Drugs or alcohol can significantly impair the ability to operate a vessel safely.
7. Failure to Comply with Officer's Demand (Section 254(5)):

11. Interfering with Aids to Navigation (Section 439):
- Offense: Removing, altering, or concealing aids to navigation (buoys, day beacons, etc.).
- Example: Tying up to a buoy or anchoring next to one can disrupt its intended function, leading to navigational hazards.
12. Operating While Disqualified (Section 259(4)):
- Offense: Operating a vessel while legally prohibited from doing so (e.g., due to a previous conviction or suspended license).
## Summary of Penalties and Enforcement:
- Fines and Jail Time: Operators violating these sections can face fines, imprisonment, or both.
- Impaired Operation: For impaired operation (under the influence of drugs or alcohol), punishments increase with repeated offenses.
- Careless Operation: Careless operation that endangers other people or vessels can result in charges, fines, or other legal consequences.
- Duty to Assist: Failing to stop and help after an accident is punishable, as is failing to assist people in danger on the water.
##### Always Operate Responsibly: Ensure that you have a sober and capable operator, avoid operating at dangerous speeds, and always have a spotter when towing. Violating these laws can not only lead to penalties but also put lives at risk.

### Minimum Legal Requirements:
#### Laws Are the Minimum Standard: The laws regarding boating safety, conduct, and equipment are the minimum standards you must follow. However, it is always recommended that boaters aim to exceed these minimum requirements to ensure a safer experience on the water.
#### No Exemptions:
- No Age Exemptions or Grandfather Clauses: The laws apply to all boaters, regardless of age or experience, and there are no exemptions for age or previous practices.
- Applies to All Boat Operators: These rules apply universally to all boaters in Canada, except in Nunavut.
### Authorities Responsible for Enforcement:
#### Various Enforcement Bodies:
- Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
- Provincial and Municipal Police Forces
- Harbour, River, County Police Forces
- Designated Enforcement Officers (including marine patrols)
##### Their Role: Enforcement officers are responsible for ensuring that boaters comply with the laws and regulations governing vessel operation.

#### Powers of Enforcement Officers:
##### Enforcement officers have broad powers to ensure compliance with the boating laws, including the authority to:
- Monitor for Careless Operation: Officers can observe and stop vessels operating recklessly or dangerously.
- Demand that Vessels Stop: Officers can demand that you stop your vessel for inspection.
- Board and Inspect Vessels: They have the authority to board your vessel and inspect it for safety equipment, registration, and other required documents.
- Check Required Safety Equipment: They will ensure you have all the required safety gear, such as life jackets, fire extinguishers, and flares.
- Verify Your Identification and Competency: Officers can ask for your photo ID and proof of competency (such as a boating license or certification).
- Ask Pertinent Questions: They can ask you relevant questions about your vessel’s operation, equipment, and safety measures.
- Issue Fines: Enforcement officers have the authority to issue fines or other penalties if you are found in violation of the laws.

#### Government Vessels with Special Identification:
- Blue Flashing Light: Any government vessel, or a vessel owned and operated by a police force (harbour, river, county, or municipal), can use a blue flashing light to identify itself when performing law enforcement or assistance duties.

# Fisheries act & protecting aquatic life
Humans have impacted the environment in ways that harm natural systems, especially when it comes to aquatic ecosystems. Due to the increasing pollution and degradation of water bodies, it is essential that we attempt to reduce the adverse impacts on aquatic environments.
#### Aquatic Environment Defined:
In this course, the term "aquatic environment" encompasses:
- All organic and inorganic matter, as well as aquatic organisms within the body of water.
- All interactions between the parts of the aquatic ecosystem.
In simple terms, this includes everything that makes up and interacts within a body of water, from fish and aquatic plants to the water’s chemical composition and quality.

## Canadian Legislation for Aquatic Environment Protection
- To protect aquatic environments, Canada has enacted several federal and provincial statutes that regulate human activities in and around water bodies:
- Canada Shipping Act, 2001
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-10.15/ 
- Canadian Environmental Protection Act
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-15.31/ 
- Fisheries Act
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-14/ 
- Navigation Protection Act
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-22/ 
- Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act
https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/acts-regulations/acts-1992c34.htm 

## Fisheries Act: Protection of Fish and Habitat
- The Fisheries Act is of particular importance for boaters, as it offers protection for fish and their habitats. Its provisions are intended to prevent activities that could alter or destroy fish habitats. The most significant section related to pleasure craft operators is subsection 36(3), which prohibits the deposit of deleterious substances into waterways frequented by fish.
#### What is a Deleterious Substance?
##### A deleterious substance is any material that harms fish or their habitats. This can include:
- Black water (sewage) from vessels
- Oil and waste oil
- Garbage (especially plastics)
- Antifreeze or toxic chemicals
- Hazardous cleaning products (always choose eco-friendly alternatives)
##### For pleasure craft operators, this means that dumping any of these substances into the water is illegal.
#### Key Legal Provisions:
- No deposit of deleterious substances: It is illegal to deposit any harmful substances into a water body that supports fish, or where the substance may eventually reach such a water body.
- Reporting and Preventive Measures:
  - If a deleterious substance is deposited into the water, operators are required to report it to the authorities.
  - Boat operators must take immediate action to prevent or remedy the impact of such deposits.
#### Penalties and Consequences:
- It is an offence not only to deposit deleterious substances but also to fail to report such deposits or take action to minimize their harm.
- Violations can result in significant fines or penalties.
#### Reporting Pollution and Spills
- In the event of a spill or the deposition of a harmful substance, it is essential to report it to the authorities immediately. The Canadian Coast Guard provides a 24-hour emergency contact number for marine pollution incidents:
- Emergency Contact for Marine Pollution: https://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/contact/emergency-urgence/marine-pollution-marine-eng.html
- Prompt action helps mitigate the impact of pollution on aquatic ecosystems and assists in the swift remediation of the situation.

## Tips for protecting Canada’s Waters
- Keep Your Bilge Clean — Avoid Polluting Waterways
  - Never pump oily or contaminated bilge water overboard. Bilge water can contain fuel, lubricants, antifreeze, and other harmful chemicals. Instead, pump bilge water into a container and dispose of it properly onshore.
  - Use bilge sorbents (special absorbent materials) rather than detergents to clean your bilge. Dispose of used sorbents at a licensed facility.
- Proper Sewage Management
  - Do not pump sewage (black water) into harbours, shorelines, or confined waterways.
  - Vessels equipped with a toilet must have a holding tank to contain sewage until it can be properly disposed of onshore.
  - Follow all local and federal sewage disposal regulations.
- Dispose of Garbage Responsibly
  - Never throw garbage, especially plastic, overboard. Plastic debris harms aquatic wildlife and pollutes waterways.
  - Always bring your garbage ashore for proper disposal.
- Use Environmentally Friendly Cleaning Products
  - Use biodegradable cleaners sparingly.
  - Avoid detergents containing phosphate as they promote harmful algae blooms that deplete oxygen in water and kill fish.
  - Prefer cleaning products that break down naturally in the environment.
- Refuelling Practices to Prevent Spills
  - Insert the fuel nozzle fully into the tank to avoid spills.
  - Do not “top off” your tank after filling.
  - Clean up any spilled fuel immediately with absorbent materials—do not wash it into the water.
  - Use a funnel when topping up motor oil to prevent spills and wipe up any drips.
- Use Approved Marine Paints
  - Choose marine-approved paints for your boat hull.
  - Avoid or minimize the use of toxic anti-fouling paints.
  - Keep your hull waxed and clean regularly to reduce fouling.
  - Dispose of leftover paint and empty cans at toxic waste disposal centres, not in regular garbage.
- Minimize Wake and Propeller Wash
  - Operate at reduced speeds near shorelines to prevent erosion, damage to property, and disturbance to wildlife and other water users.
  - Canadian regulations require boaters to moderate speed near shore.
- Report Pollution Incidents
  - If you see pollution or evidence of pollution, report it promptly to Transport Canada or the Canadian Coast Guard.
- Prevent the Spread of Invasive Species
  - Inspect and remove plants and animals from your boat, trailer, anchor, and fishing gear before leaving any waterbody.
  - Drain water from the motor, bilge, and transom wells.
  - Never release live bait or aquatic animals into the water.
  - Rinse boats and equipment with fresh water.
  - Dry your boat and equipment for at least five days before moving to another body of water, as some invasive species can survive out of water for several days.

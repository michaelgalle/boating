# Operating a vessel
## Departing
### Casting Off
#### Push the vessel away from the dock before engaging the motor. Make sure:
- The stern is at least 1 foot (0.33 m) from the dock.
- The bow is angled away from the dock.
- Depart slowly, especially in shallow water, to avoid striking bottom with the propeller.
- Know the depth of the water where you're casting off.
#### Passenger Positioning
- All passengers must be seated before the boat begins moving.
- Never sit on:
  - The bow
  - Gunwales (sides)
  - The stern
  - The transom
  - The swim platform
- These areas are dangerous while the boat is in motion or the motor is running.
#### Propeller & Motor Safety
- Always check for people in the water before starting the engine.
- Never start the motor in gear.
- Always turn off the engine when:
  - Someone is entering or exiting the boat.
  - Retrieving a person from the water.
  - Anyone is near the stern.
  - Never back up toward a person in the water.
#### Passenger Supervision
- Assign a responsible adult to supervise children at all times.
#### Steering & Collision Avoidance
- Boats don’t have brakes. You must be moving to steer.
- Always allow extra distance between your vessel and others.
- Use wide turns at low speeds—you need to turn the wheel more when going slow.
#### Stay Clear of Swimming Zones
- Avoid marked swimming areas and known diving zones.
- Even small boats can seriously injure swimmers.
- Sharing the water, lookout, safe speed (safe wake and wash)
#### Dangerous Behaviours to Avoid
Never:
- “Buzz” other boats, swimmers, or shoreline users.
- Try to spray other vessels or people with your wake.
- Jump the wakes of other boats.
- Cross directly in front of other vessels.
- Drive close to other boats or paddle craft.
Misjudging speed or distance while performing these actions has caused some of the worst boating accidents.

### Best Practices When Sharing the Water
#### Keep well clear of:
- Swimmers
- Paddle craft (kayaks, canoes, SUPs)
- Wildlife
- Waterfront properties
#### Reduce your speed:
- Near others
- In no-wake zones
- To minimize noise and wake
#### Minimize your wake to avoid:
- Eroding shorelines
- Disturbing wildlife (especially nesting birds)
- Swamping or capsizing smaller boats

### Navigational Conduct
- Follow the Collision Regulations, especially regarding safe speed in different conditions.
- Know the local restrictions, such as:
  - Speed limits
  - Engine power limits
  - No-wake or no-motor zones
  - Use courtesy and common sense at all times.
#### Know Your Boat
- Practice handling and turning at both low and high speeds.
- If you have a planing hull:
  - Learn the speed at which it planes (rises on top of the water).
  - At low speeds, your hull plows through the water and makes large waves.
  - When on plane, your wake is smaller—this is safer for the environment and other users.
  - Adjust your trim so the hull tilts up about 3 degrees from horizontal for best performance and lowest wake.

### Diver Safety: Operating Near Diving Activity
#### Recognize the Dive Flags
- International Code Flag “A”
  - Blue & white
  - Meaning: “I have a diver down. Keep well clear and proceed at slow speed.”
  - Used on boats actively supporting a dive operation.
- Red & white diver flag (Private Buoy Regulations)
  - Displayed on surface buoys marking active dive sites.
#### Safety Rules for Boaters
- If you see a diver flag or diving buoy:
  - Stay at least 100 metres away
  - Maintain a slow speed
  - Keep a sharp lookout — divers may surface away from their buoy
  - Never assume the diver is directly beneath the flag or buoy — always proceed with caution
- Additional Tips
  - Diving areas are often not marked on charts — if unfamiliar with an area, ask locals about popular dive spots.
  - Rules 18 & 27 of the Collision Regulations require all vessels to reduce speed and steer clear of boats displaying a “diver down” flag.

### Attentive lookout
#### Every pleasure craft operator must:
- Maintain a constant and attentive lookout using sight and hearing
- Use all available means (visual, auditory, radar, radio if equipped)
- Assess whether a risk of collision exists — and act accordingly
#### When It Applies
- Anytime the vessel is underway, including:
  - Moving under power
  - Drifting with current or wind (A drifting boat is still “underway”)
#### Listen and Signal
##### Listen for:
- Horns, whistles, or other vessels’ sound signals
- Calls for help or signals of distress
##### Use your own sound signaling devices (horn, whistle, bell) to:
- Announce your presence
- Warn other vessels
- Respond to distress situations
##### Legal Reminder
- Under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, all operators are required to:
  - Watch for distress signals
  - Render assistance if safe and able

### Safe speeds
#### Operating at a Safe Speed
- Definition: A safe speed is one at which you can:
  - Take proper and effective action to avoid a collision
  - Stop within an appropriate distance for the conditions
#### Factors to Consider When Determining Safe Speed:
##### Visibility
- Fog, mist, rain, and darkness reduce reaction time.
- Traffic Density
- Number, size, speed, and direction of nearby vessels.
- Wind, Water Conditions, Currents
- Waves and wind affect vessel control.
- Your Vessel’s Manoeuvrability
- How quickly you can turn or stop.
- Proximity of Hazards
- Watch for docks, rocks, piers, and other obstructions.
##### In Restricted Visibility
- When visibility is poor and other vessels are not in sight:
  - Proceed at a safe, reduced speed
  - Use sound signals (long and short blasts) to indicate your presence

### Responsibility for Wake & Wash
- You are legally responsible for any damage or risk caused by your vessel’s wake and wash.
- Always proceed with caution to avoid disturbing:
  - Anchored or small vessels (e.g. kayaks, canoes)
  - Shorelines and wetlands (to prevent erosion)
  - Docks and anchored boats
  - Wildlife (e.g. nesting birds)
  - Swimmers, divers, and bathers
#### Important Reminders:
- Boats do not have brakes — plan your stops early
- At high speeds: less control, longer stopping distance
- Slow down in rough weather to maintain control
- Wake damage = operator liability

### Compass use
Magnetic Compass: Key Functions
#### A magnetic compass (or compass-bearing device) helps you:
- Determine cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)
- Take bearings on buoys or landmarks
- Maintain a heading or navigate a course — essential in poor visibility (e.g., fog or mist)
#### Compass Requirements Under Canadian Regulations
- Vessel Length	Compass Requirement
  - ≤ 8 metres (26 ft.)	Not required if operating within sight of seamarks
  - Navigating outside seamarks	Must carry a magnetic compass (any vessel length)
- ≥ 12 metres (39.4 ft.)	Must carry a compass that meets Navigation Safety Regulations
##### Important Reminders for usage
- Keep metal objects and magnets (like speakers, tools, batteries) away from the compass — they distort its readings.
- Avoid running electrical wiring near the compass.
- Place a permanently mounted compass at the helm (binnacle) if possible, for continuous reference.
- A hand-held compass is useful for smaller vessels and emergency use.
##### Why Every Pleasure Craft Should Carry One
- Crucial for navigation when GPS fails or batteries die
- Helps you return to shore safely in fog or poor visibility
- Simple, durable, and reliable—no power needed

## Weather, water hazards, and protecting aquatic life
### Monitoring the Weather
- When you’re out on the water, it’s important to regularly check the weather and confirm that conditions match what was forecast. Weather can change quickly, especially during summer thunderstorms, so staying alert helps you stay safe.
#### Signs of Approaching Bad Weather
- Darkening skies and rapidly changing cloud cover
- Falling barometric pressure
- Increasing wind speed
- Shifts in wind direction (which often lead to bigger waves)
If you notice these signs, head for shore as soon as possible. Plan ahead by checking your charts to know where the closest safe shelter is.
#### Getting Weather Updates Onboard
- Pleasure craft operators should know how to get weather updates while underway. Using a marine radio is an essential skill. Many marine supply stores sell receivers that provide continuous weather forecasts.
#### What to Do if Caught in Bad Weather
##### If you find yourself in heavy weather, such as a thunderstorm:
- Reduce your speed to maintain control of your vessel
- Head for the nearest safe shore you can reach
- Ensure everyone on board is wearing their Personal Flotation Device (PFD) or lifejacket
- Secure any loose gear but keep emergency equipment (anchor, bailers, paddles) ready
##### If caught in a squall (a sudden, strong wind):
- Take note of your compass heading so you can return to your original course later
- Turn your vessel to face into the wind to better manage waves
##### Handling Waves in Heavy Weather
- Try to keep your vessel on a course that minimizes the chance of waves washing onboard. Avoid traveling straight downwind if you can. If you must move downwind (for example, to reach shore):
- Don’t go directly downwind, especially if you have an open cockpit
- Instead, steer a zigzag path, crossing waves at about a 45-degree angle
- This helps prevent waves from hitting the stern (back) of the boat directly, which can cause flooding

## Local Water Hazards
When operating a pleasure craft, being aware of local water hazards is crucial to ensure your safety and avoid accidents. These hazards can hinder your vessel’s operation or increase the risk of injury or loss of life for those on board. Common hazards include:
- Low-head dams
- Rapids
- Sudden winds
- Tides and currents
- Shoals (shallow areas)
- White water
- Overhead cables and bridges
- Rapid build-up of high waves
- Floating debris

### Preparation Beyond Equipment
Boating safety is more than just having a well-maintained boat. Before venturing into a new area, always:
- Study marine charts to identify potential underwater hazards (e.g., reefs, cables) and overhead obstacles (e.g., bridges).
- Consult supplementary publications like Sailing Directions, Tide Tables, and Atlases of Currents to understand water depths, tide times (high, slack, low), and current flows.
- Gather as much local knowledge as possible about the area you plan to navigate.
If marine charts are unavailable, ask experienced local boaters or residents about hazards such as low-head dams, rapids, or shoals. This is especially important for operators of small, unstable craft like canoes and sailboards, as hazards like strong currents and commercial shipping lanes pose significant risks.

### Common Local Water Hazards
#### Low-Head Dams
Many inland waterways have low-head dams (usually less than 4 meters / 13 feet high) to maintain water depth upstream. Although small and seemingly harmless, these dams become extremely dangerous during high runoff periods (e.g., spring thaw or after heavy rains). Water flowing over the dam creates a powerful backwash at the base, generating a recirculating current that can trap and drown people or capsize boats. This hazard affects anyone approaching from upstream or downstream. Always stay well clear of low-head dams.
#### Sudden Winds
Certain valleys and mountainous areas can funnel wind, causing sudden powerful gusts that can easily overturn light boats. Be especially cautious when boating on mountain lakes or waters surrounded by steep hills.
#### Shoals (Shallow Areas)
Shoals are shallow zones where boats risk running aground. They can be numerous and often unmarked by buoys, so always consult marine charts to identify their locations.
#### Tides and Currents
In tidal areas such as estuaries, tides can drastically change water depth and affect navigation. Use tide tables to check times of high, slack, and low tides to avoid getting stranded. Currents can create hazardous conditions, especially where opposing currents or winds cause choppy, unpredictable waves.
#### Rapids and Strong Currents
Rapids are fast-moving, shallow stretches of rivers or streams where steering is difficult. Standing waves in rapids can swamp or capsize boats, and submerged rocks pose collision risks. Avoid rapids and strong currents to maintain control and safety.
#### Underwater Cables and Pipelines
Anchors can snag on underwater cables or pipelines, potentially causing the boat to capsize when trying to weigh anchor. Shore signs and marine charts typically mark these hazards. Always verify their locations before anchoring.
#### Overhead Obstacles
Obstacles such as power lines, cables, and bridges require careful navigation, especially for boats with tall masts or superstructures. Striking an overhead obstacle can cause serious damage or electrocution. Always ensure sufficient clearance before passing under such hazards.
#### Rapid Build-Up of High Wave Conditions
When waves move from deep to suddenly shallow water, their height can increase rapidly, especially with wind. This phenomenon is common on Canadian coastlines and large lakes and can be dangerous near shorelines during storms.
#### Floating Debris After Heavy Rain or Water Rise
After heavy rains or rising streams, floating debris such as logs, lumber, and deadheads can be carried into waterways. Always watch carefully for these obstacles, which can damage boats or cause accidents.
##### Stay vigilant and informed, and always plan your trips with a thorough understanding of local water conditions and hazards to enjoy a safe and fun boating experience.

## Anchoring 
- Anchoring is a vital safety measure used to secure your vessel near shore during bad weather or if your craft is disabled. Proper anchoring prevents drifting into dangerous areas and helps keep everyone on board safe.
### Choosing the Right Anchor and Equipment
- Anchor Type and Size: Select an anchor and cable fittings suited to your vessel’s size, the bottom conditions, and the expected wind and wave forces. Using an undersized anchor or cable risks dragging, which can cause your boat to drift—especially dangerous if people are asleep or swimming nearby.
- Multiple Anchors Recommended: Carry at least two types of anchors, including one large enough for adverse weather.
- Anchor Line Length (Rode): The Small Vessel Regulations specify minimum lengths:
  - Up to 9 metres: at least 15 metres of chain, cable, or rope
  - Over 9 up to 12 metres: at least 30 metres
  - Over 12 metres: at least 50 metres
- Secure Fittings: Ensure the shackle pin has a locking device, properly secured.
### Preparing to Anchor
- Check Water Depth: Verify there is enough depth for your hull to clear the bottom and enough scope in the anchor line, considering tide changes.
- Swing Room: Ensure the anchorage allows your boat to swing safely if the wind direction changes.
#### Scope Ratio: Scope is the ratio of anchor rode length to water depth.
- Calm conditions or overnight stays: 6:1 scope ratio
- Windy/wave conditions: 8:1 scope ratio
- Storm conditions: 10:1 scope ratio
##### Attachment: Confirm one end of the anchor line is securely attached to the vessel and the other end to the anchor before deployment.
##### Deployment: Lower the anchor slowly from the bow (do not throw it overboard).
- Pay out at least six times the depth in anchor rode.
- Tie off the line on a cleat.
- Reverse the boat slowly until the anchor line tightens, indicating the anchor is set.
### Common Types of Anchors and Their Uses
- Lightweight (Danforth): Two long flukes, lightweight with strong holding power; best for sand, gravel, or mud. Not good for rocky or grassy bottoms.
- Mushroom: Heavy, permanent mooring anchors; not practical for recreational boats.
- Grapnel: Small anchors with multiple arms; good for rocky bottoms, poor holding in mud/sand/gravel. Common for canoes or very small boats.
- Kedge (Navy): Traditional style, heavy and large; works well in grassy or rocky areas, mostly for large vessels.
- Claw (Bruce): Single fluke with curved shape; holds well in sand, rock, and mud, allows full circle swing without losing grip.
- Plough: Popular for cruisers; good all-around holding in sand, rock, mud, clay, and grass; resets easily.
### Safety Reminders
- Never set an anchor over the side or stern of a boat under 6 metres (20 ft), as waves can swamp the vessel.
- Use an anchor chain between the anchor and rope line; the chain’s weight helps the anchor set firmly.
- Consider using a kellet — a weight attached partway down the anchor line to keep the rode’s angle low, improving anchor holding.
- Always monitor your anchor for dragging, especially during overnight stays or poor weather.
- Adapt your anchor type and size to the bottom type and weather conditions you expect to encounter.

## Impairments to operation while underway: Staying safe on the water 
- Operating a pleasure craft requires careful attention to factors that can cause fatigue and impair your ability to navigate safely. These include the motion of the vessel, exposure to sunlight and wind, waves, sound, and alcohol consumption. Each of these — alone or combined — can negatively affect alertness, balance, coordination, reflexes, judgment, response time, eyesight, and hearing. Motion sickness, resulting in nausea, is also common.

### Managing Fatigue and Environmental Effects
A responsible boater is aware of how these factors can impact safety and takes proactive steps to reduce their effects, including:
- Getting plenty of rest before heading out on the water.
- Wearing sunglasses to reduce glare from the sun reflecting off the water.
- Using sunscreen to protect skin from harmful UV rays.
- Staying hydrated by drinking water or juice.
- Recognizing early symptoms of fatigue or motion sickness is key to preventing accidents.

### Alcohol and Boating: The Risks and Legal Consequences
Never consume alcohol or drugs before or while operating a pleasure craft. Canadian law treats impaired boating the same as impaired driving on land. Under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to operate a boat with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over 0.08% (80 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood). Penalties for impaired boating are the same as for impaired driving.
#### Where Alcohol Is Allowed
- In most provinces, alcohol consumption is legally permitted only in three places:
  - Licensed establishments
  - Licensed events
  - Private residences
- Having open alcohol containers or drinking onboard a boat is illegal, just like in a vehicle.

### The Danger of Alcohol on the Water
Alcohol impairs your senses, judgment, and reaction times — and these effects are worsened by fatigue, sun exposure, wind, and the motion of the boat. The combination significantly increases the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities.
Operating a boat under the influence is as dangerous and illegal as driving a car while intoxicated. You could also lose your driver’s license if caught impaired while operating any motorized vehicle, including boats, ATVs, or snowmobiles.
#### A Crucial Reminder
- Wait until after your fishing, hunting, or boating activities are finished before drinking alcohol. Always remember that you are responsible not only for your own safety but also for everyone on board. Drinking alcohol while on a boat significantly increases your risk of drowning if you fall overboard and will heighten the effects of hours of exposure to sun, wind, and motion.

## Towing Activities Safety Guidelines
Under the Small Vessel Regulations, all towing activities are governed by the same rules that apply to water-skiing. This includes:
- Barefoot skiing
- Tubing
- Knee boarding
- Wakeboarding
- Parasailing
### Requirements:
- Spotter Required: A spotter must be on board at all times to watch the person being towed.
- Seating for Towed Persons: There must be a dedicated seat available for each person being towed. This ensures safe recovery if needed. For personal watercraft, only those designed to carry three or more people may tow someone.
- Towing Time Restrictions: Towing is prohibited from one hour after sunset until sunrise.
- No Remote Control: Vessels towing water skiers or others cannot be remotely controlled.
#### Communication and Safety:
- Water skiers must be able to communicate with the towboat operator using standard hand signals.
- The boat operator must know these signals and ensure both the skier and spotter understand them.
#### Standard Hand Signals for Water Skiers:
- Effective communication between the skier, spotter, and operator is essential for safety. Water skiers use the following standard hand signals to convey their intentions:
  - Raised hand with open palm:	Stop or "Slow down"
  - Raised clenched fist: Speed up
  - Arm extended straight out, waving: Turn left
  - Arm extended straight out, waving on the right side: Turn right
  - Both hands raised above head: Fall or emergency — stop towing immediately
- Note: The boat operator and spotter must understand these signals and always watch the skier carefully.

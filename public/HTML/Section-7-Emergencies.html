As the operator, it’s your responsibility to reduce the risk of mechanical failure and ensure that all equipment is functional.</h5>
<h2 id="maintenance-schedule">Maintenance Schedule</h2>
<p>At a minimum, inspect your vessel and safety equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of each boating season</li>
<li>Once per month throughout the season</li>
<li>This includes both the boat’s mechanical systems and all required safety gear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fire">Fire</h2>
<h3 id="responding-to-fire-on-board">Responding to Fire On Board</h3>
<ul>
<li>A fire on board a vessel is a serious emergency. Quick action and calm decision-making are essential to protect everyone’s safety.<h4 id="step-1-ensure-everyone-puts-on-a-flotation-device">Step 1: Ensure Everyone Puts On a Flotation Device</h4>
</li>

<li>Note: Fires often reignite if extinguishers are stopped too soon. Always ensure the fire is fully out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="know-your-equipment">Know Your Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your boat carries the appropriate number and type of portable fire extinguishers as required by Transport Canada.</li>
<li>Even if your boat is equipped with an automatic fire suppression system (e.g., inboard engine compartments), portable extinguishers are still mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="person-overboard">Person overboard</h2>
<ul>
<li>Falling overboard is one of the leading causes of boating fatalities in Canada. Quick, calm, and informed action can make the difference between life and death.<h3 id="emergency-procedure-person-overboard">Emergency Procedure: Person Overboard</h3>
</li>
<li>Sound the Alarm</li>
<li>Shout “Man Overboard!” and alert everyone onboard.</li>
<li>Slow Down and Stop (If Safe)</li>
<li>Immediately reduce speed. Stop the engine if possible and safe.</li>
<li>Throw a buoyant object (life ring, cushion, or fender) toward the person. This helps them float and marks their position if they submerge.</li>
<li>Assign a Spotter<ul>
<li>Designate one crew member (not the driver) to keep constant visual contact.</li>
<li>They should continuously point toward the person in the water to help guide the operator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maneuver the Vessel<ul>
<li>Carefully navigate to a position downwind of the victim.</li>
<li>Always approach from downwind or into the current if it is stronger and recover the person over the windward side to prevent the boat from drifting over them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use Rescue Equipment<ul>
<li>Use a lifebuoy, buoyant heaving line, or boat ladder.</li>
<li>If a reboarding device is not available, secure both ends of a line to the boat and drape it over the side to serve as a step.<h4 id="practice-preparation">Practice &amp; Preparation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rehearse man-overboard recovery procedures regularly with your crew.</li>
<li>Conduct practice drills using a floating object like a stick or lifejacket.</li>
<li>Practice recovery at night, in rough water, or when visibility is poor.</li>
<li>Ensure your heaving line is always untangled and ready to throw instantly.<h3 id="key-hazards-for-a-person-overboard">Key Hazards for a Person Overboard</h3>
</li>
<li>Hypothermia (especially in cold Canadian waters)</li>
<li>Drowning (especially without a PFD)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stay low and centered when moving around — don’t “rock the boat.”</li>
<li>Never sit or stand on the gunwale or bow while underway.</li>
<li>Use one hand to work, one hand to hold onto the boat.</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol while boating — it impairs balance, reflexes, and judgment.</li>
<li>Go ashore in bad weather — don’t push your equipment or your luck.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collisions">Collisions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Collisions on the water—whether with submerged objects or other vessels—can quickly become life-threatening. Knowing how to respond can save lives and reduce damage.<h3 id="types-of-collisions">Types of Collisions</h3>
<h4 id="1-submerged-object-collision">1. Submerged Object Collision</h4>
If your vessel hits a submerged object:</li>
<li>Have everyone immediately put on a lifejacket or personal flotation device (PFD).</li>
<li>Steer toward the nearest safe location at reduced speed.</li>
<li>Assess your vessel for damage. Check for signs of hull breach or flooding.<h4 id="2-vessel-to-vessel-collision">2. Vessel-to-Vessel Collision</h4>
If you collide with another vessel:</li>
<li>Ensure all passengers on both vessels put on PFDs right away.</li>
<li>Assess the damage to both vessels.</li>
<li>Issue a distress signal if either vessel is in danger of sinking or life is at risk.</li>
<li>Focus first on stabilizing the less-damaged vessel.</li>
<li>Then attempt to assist the other vessel as safely as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="legal-responsibilities">Legal Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Under Canadian law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal Code of Canada: You must render assistance in a vessel collision, especially where human life is in danger.</li>
<li>Canada Shipping Act, 2001 – Section 451: If you encounter a collision scene, you must assist any person in danger on the water, as long as doing so doesn’t place your own vessel or crew at serious risk.</li>
<li>Information Exchange: All operators involved in a collision, even if the damage is minor, are legally required to exchange:<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preventing-collisions">Preventing Collisions</h3>
<p>The best way to survive a collision is to avoid it altogether. Follow these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operate at a Safe Speed: operate at a speed that allows time to avoid hazards or traffic.</li>
<li>Slow Down in busy areas: Reduced speed gives more time to react to other vessels, swimmers, or unexpected obstacles.</li>
<li>Watch for Swimmers and Divers: Stay far away from marked swimming and diving zones.</li>
<li>Maintain an attentive Lookout: Continuously scan your surroundings. Know who’s around, where they’re going, and how fast they’re moving.</li>
<li>Never consume alcohol: Alcohol impairs reflexes, judgment, balance, and coordination—and is a leading cause of boating accidents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cold-water-shock-and-hypothermia">Cold water shock and Hypothermia</h2>
<p>Cold water shock is one of the most deadly and misunderstood dangers in recreational boating. Sudden immersion in cold water can quickly lead to drowning—even for strong swimmers.</p>
<h3 id="cold-water-shock-facts">Cold Water Shock Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>An average of 149 people die each year in Canada from cold water immersion (Transport Canada).</li>
<li>60% of drowning deaths in 2004 occurred in water colder than 10°C.</li>
<li>Most victims were not wearing a flotation device.</li>
<li>Many drown within swimming distance of safety.<h3 id="what-is-cold-water-shock-">What Is Cold Water Shock?</h3>
</li>
<li>Cold water shock is the body’s automatic reaction to sudden immersion in water colder than 15°C. It has two dangerous stages:<h4 id="1-initial-shock-0-1-minute-">1. Initial Shock (0–1 Minute)</h4>
</li>
<li>Involuntary gasping</li>

<li>Muscle paralysis (you may not be able to swim)<h4 id="2-cold-incapacitation-1-10-minutes-">2. Cold Incapacitation (1–10 Minutes)</h4>
</li>
<li>Loss of muscle control in arms and legs</li>
<li>Inability to swim or self-rescue</li>
<li>High risk of drowning without a flotation device</li>
<li>Important: If you are not wearing a PFD when you enter cold water, your chance of survival drops dramatically.<h4 id="prevention-is-critical">Prevention Is Critical</h4>
To reduce your risk of cold water shock:</li>
<li>Always wear a Transport Canada–approved lifejacket or PFD.</li>
<li>Avoid overloading your boat.</li>
<li>Stay ashore in bad weather (high winds, large waves).</li>
<li>Keep your balance and avoid sudden movements on deck.</li>
<li>Wearing a flotation device is the single most effective way to survive cold water shock. It keeps you afloat while you regain control of your breathing.<h4 id="recognizing-and-treating-cold-water-shock">Recognizing and Treating Cold Water Shock</h4>
<h5 id="if-a-person-is-immersed-in-cold-water-">If a person is immersed in cold water:</h5>

<li>Final Stage: Unconsciousness, very weak or absent pulse and respiration<h4 id="preventing-hypothermia">Preventing Hypothermia</h4>
To delay or prevent hypothermia:</li>
<li>Always wear a PFD or lifejacket (helps insulate and keeps you afloat).</li>
<li>Dress in layers with windproof and waterproof outerwear.</li>
<li>Avoid overloading your boat and stay off the water in bad weather.</li>
<li>Stay still in the water to conserve energy and heat.</li>
<li>Climb onto a floating object to reduce immersion.</li>
<li>If alone, cross arms tightly on chest and cross legs and draw up knees</li>
<li>If in a group, gather close, wrap arms and legs together to conserve body heat<h4 id="treatment-for-mild-early-stage-hypothermia">Treatment for Mild (Early-Stage) Hypothermia</h4>
</li>
<li>Remove victim from cold exposure (e.g., out of water).</li>
<li>Shelter in a warm, dry place (tent, cabin, etc.).</li>

      <h2>Review: Emergencies</h2>
      <h3>Emergency Procedures and Response</h3>
      <h4>Types of Emergencies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Capsizing: Remain calm, stay with the vessel if possible, and signal for help. Only swim to shore if it is very close and you are a strong swimmer.</li>
        <li>Man Overboard: Immediately throw a flotation device, keep the person in sight, and approach from downwind. Use a ladder or assist the person back on board.</li>
        <li>Fire: Stop the engine, use a fire extinguisher, and move passengers away from the fire. If the fire cannot be controlled, prepare to abandon ship.</li>
        <li>Flooding: Use bilge pumps or buckets to remove water. Find and stop the source of flooding if possible.</li>
        <li>Collision: Check for injuries, assess vessel damage, and signal for help if needed. Exchange information with other parties involved.</li>
        <li>Grounding: Stop the engine, check for leaks, and try to refloat the vessel by shifting weight or using a boat hook or paddle.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Distress Signals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual: Flares, orange smoke, signal mirror, waving arms, or displaying a distress flag (square flag with a ball above or below).</li>
        <li>Sound: Whistle, horn, bell, or continuous sounding of any sound-producing device.</li>
        <li>Radio: Use VHF Channel 16 to call for help. State "MAYDAY" for life-threatening emergencies, "PAN-PAN" for urgent situations, and "SECURITE" for safety messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>First Aid and Hypothermia</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>First Aid: Treat injuries promptly. Stop bleeding, perform CPR if needed, and keep injured persons warm and comfortable.</li>
        <li>Hypothermia: Remove wet clothing, insulate the person, and provide warm, non-alcoholic drinks. Seek medical help as soon as possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Prevention and Preparation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Always wear a lifejacket or PFD.</li>
        <li>Carry required safety equipment and know how to use it.</li>
        <li>File a sail plan and inform someone of your trip details.</li>
        <li>Check weather and water conditions before departure.</li>
        <li>Take a boating safety course and practice emergency procedures.</li>
      </ul>

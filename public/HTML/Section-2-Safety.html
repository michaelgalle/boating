<h2 id="small-vessel-regulations-compliance-notice">Small vessel regulations - Compliance notice</h2>
<p>The Small Vessel Regulations apply to all boaters operating on Canadian waters. These regulations are important to ensure safety and compliance when operating any recreational vessel. Here&#39;s what they cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading Limits: The regulations outline the maximum load a vessel can carry, including passengers, fuel, and cargo. This ensures the vessel is not overloaded and can operate safely.</li>
<li>Power Limits: The regulations specify the maximum engine power that a vessel can safely use based on its design. This prevents over-powering the vessel, which can lead to stability issues or unsafe operation.</li>
<li>Licensing and Registration Requirements: These rules specify the requirements for registering and licensing a vessel. This is necessary to operate legally on Canadian waters.</li>
<li>Mandatory Safety Equipment: The regulations list the essential safety equipment that must be on board, such as life jackets, fire extinguishers, and distress signals. Having the required equipment is crucial for the safety of everyone aboard.</li>
<li>Safety Precautions: The regulations outline various safety precautions that must be taken while operating a pleasure craft. This includes operating at safe speeds, adhering to navigation rules, and taking care when embarking or disembarking.<h5 id="a-compliance-notice-is-required-by-transport-canada-for-any-pleasure-craft-that-is-propelled-or-designed-to-be-propelled-by-a-motor-this-notice-must-be-permanently-affixed-to-the-hull-of-the-vessel-and-is-usually-located-on-the-stern-back-where-it-is-easily-visible-to-the-operator-">A Compliance Notice is required by Transport Canada for any pleasure craft that is propelled (or designed to be propelled) by a motor. This notice must be permanently affixed to the hull of the vessel and is usually located on the stern (back) where it is easily visible to the operator.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-included-in-a-compliance-notice-">What is Included in a Compliance Notice?</h4>
<p>The Compliance Notice displays several critical pieces of information:</p>
<h5 id="recommended-gross-load-capacity-">Recommended Gross Load Capacity:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Maximum load the vessel can carry (including passengers, motor, fuel, and cargo).</li>
<li>Maximum number of people (adult-sized) that the vessel can safely carry.</li>
<li>Recommended engine power limit, if the vessel is designed for an outboard motor.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="compliance-requirements-">Compliance Requirements:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The operator of the vessel must not exceed the limits indicated on the Compliance Notice. This includes ensuring the vessel does not carry more weight than recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="important-notes-on-compliance-notices-">Important Notes on Compliance Notices:</h5>
<p>The load and power limits on the Compliance Notice assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vessel will be operated in fair weather.</li>
<li>The weight of people and equipment is evenly distributed to balance the hull.</li>
</ul>
<p>In adverse weather conditions, such as high winds or large waves, the load and power limits no longer apply. The vessel should be operated with a reduced load. Operators must account for weather and water conditions when planning trips.</p>
<h5 id="practical-example-">Practical Example:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Vessel Size: A vessel less than 6 meters (20 feet) in length requires a Compliance Notice.</li>
<li>Details: The Compliance Notice on such a vessel will show:</li>
<li>Recommended gross load capacity (maximum weight of people, motor, fuel, and cargo).</li>
<li>Safe engine power limit for the vessel.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important for operators to be aware of these limits to ensure safety and avoid overloading, which can affect the vessel’s performance and stability.</p>

<li>Accessible and Available</li>
<li>Maintained and replaced according to manufacturer’s instructions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-protective-equipment">Personal protective equipment</h2>
<p>A PFD or lifejacket must be approved by one of the following agencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport Canada</li>
<li>Fisheries and Oceans Canada</li>
<li>The Canadian Coast Guard</li>
<li>If you are visiting Canada, you may also use flotation devices that conform to the laws of your home country, provided they meet the same standards for buoyancy and safety.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="choosing-the-right-flotation-device">Choosing the Right Flotation Device</h5>
<p>When purchasing a flotation device, make sure it is appropriate for your size, weight, and boating activity. Here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size Matters: A PFD that is too small will not provide sufficient buoyancy, while one that is too large may be uncomfortable and ineffective.</li>
<li>Visibility: Bright colors like red, orange, and yellow are ideal for PFDs because they are the most visible in the water, aiding in search and rescue efforts.</li>
<li>Condition Check: At the start of each boating season, test your PFD in the water to make sure it works effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="lifejackets">Lifejackets</h5>
<p>A lifejacket is specifically designed to keep an unconscious person face-up in the water, even in cold water. It is crucial for situations where hypothermia could cause a person to lose consciousness.</p>

<li>Important Note: Children under 16 are not allowed to wear inflatable lifejackets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="personal-flotation-devices-pfds-">Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs)</h4>
<ul>
<li>A PFD is designed to keep a conscious person’s chin out of the water. They are more suitable for active sports like water skiing or kayaking but do not provide the same level of support as lifejackets for unconscious individuals.<h5 id="key-features-of-pfds-">Key Features of PFDs:</h5>
</li>
<li>Buoyancy: PFDs are less buoyant than lifejackets, so they may not be as effective in rough waters.</li>
<li>Not for Unconscious People: Unlike lifejackets, PFDs are not designed to keep an unconscious person face-up in the water.<h5 id="how-to-maintain-your-pfd-or-lifejacket">How to Maintain Your PFD or Lifejacket</h5>
</li>
<li>Avoid Damage: The approved status of a PFD or lifejacket lapses if it’s damaged, altered, or repaired. For example, if the foam material inside is damaged, it should be replaced.</li>
<li>Cleaning: Use a mild soapy solution for cleaning. Avoid using gasoline, dry cleaning fluids, or solvents, as they can damage the flotation materials.</li>
<li>Storage: Store your PFD or lifejacket in a dry, well-ventilated, and accessible area. Avoid exposing them to prolonged sunlight or direct heat.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="keeping-children-safe-with-flotation-devices">Keeping Children Safe with Flotation Devices</h4>
<ul>
<li>Supervision: A PFD or lifejacket is not a substitute for adult supervision. Always keep children within arm&#39;s reach when they are near water.</li>
<li>Fit Check for Children: Make sure the flotation device fits snugly, especially around the child’s shoulders. You can test the fit by checking the space between the top of the shoulder and the armhole – it should not exceed three fingers.</li>
<li>Features to Look for in a Child’s PFD:<ul>
<li>Large Collar: For head support and to keep the child’s head above water.</li>
<li>Safety Straps: Between the legs and buckles for extra security.</li>
<li>Reflective Tape: For better visibility during a rescue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="inflatable-pfds">Inflatable PFDs</h5>
<ul>
<li>Inflatable PFDs are gaining popularity due to their compactness and comfort. They are generally available in two styles:<ul>
<li>Vest Style: Can be inflated manually or automatically.</li>
<li>Pouch Style: Requires manual inflation and is considered a two-stage donning device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key Points about Inflatable PFDs:</li>
<li>Not for Children: Inflatable PFDs are not approved for anyone under 16 or anyone weighing less than 36.3 kg (80 lbs.).</li>
<li>Not for Weak Swimmers: The inflation mechanism, although fast, may not be sufficient for weak swimmers in emergency situations.</li>
<li>Maintenance: Regularly check the CO2 cartridge and ensure the PFD is functioning properly. A re-arming kit is recommended for each inflatable PFD.</li>

It&#39;s produced by incomplete combustion of fuel-burning engines and appliances (like gasoline, diesel, propane, and butane). CO is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, making it difficult to detect. Effects and treatment of CO poisoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO reduces the blood&#39;s ability to carry oxygen to body tissues, leading to asphyxiation or suffocation. It is particularly dangerous because:</li>
<li>Even at low concentrations, CO can cause injury or death (1,000 ppm may cause unconsciousness in one hour and death after four hours).</li>
<li>Symptoms of poisoning can often be mistaken for flu, food poisoning, or other illnesses.</li>
<li>In cases of prolonged exposure to high concentrations, death can occur within minutes.<h4 id="the-symptoms-of-co-poisoning-may-include-">The symptoms of CO poisoning may include:</h4>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get Fresh Air Immediately to stop the poisoning</li>
<li>If Fresh Air Is Unavailable:<ul>
<li>Open all windows and doors on the boat to ventilate the area.</li>
<li>Turn off any combustion appliances.</li>
<li>Seek medical help immediately. Go to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis and treatment.<h4 id="diagnosis-">Diagnosis:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A blood test at the hospital will confirm whether the person has suffered CO poisoning.<h4 id="prevention-tips-for-carbon-monoxide">Prevention Tips for Carbon Monoxide</h4>
</li>
<li>To prevent CO poisoning, especially in confined or enclosed spaces aboard your vessel, follow these essential safety practices:</li>
<li>Only idle your engine in well-ventilated areas.</li>
<li>Always check that the tailwinds don&#39;t carry CO fumes back onto the boat.</li>
<li>Ensure good ventilation when using fuel-burning appliances in the cabin, even in bad weather.</li>
<li>Install a marine-grade carbon monoxide detector near where people sleep.</li>
<li>Check the batteries in the CO detector before each trip.</li>
<li>Follow the manufacturer’s installation and maintenance guidelines for the detector.</li>
<li>On boats with enclosed gasoline engines or fuel tanks, run the powered ventilation blower for 4 minutes before starting the engine to ventilate the compartment.</li>
<li>Ensure the area where propane or butane appliances are used is well-ventilated.</li>
<li>Secure portable appliances so they do not cause gas leaks.</li>
<li>Install gas cylinders/tanks in well-ventilated areas and check for leaks regularly.</li>
<li>Never leave open-flame heating or cooking appliances unattended.<h4 id="special-considerations-for-swimmers">Special Considerations for Swimmers</h4>
</li>
<li>CO is also a danger to swimmers near your boat. Avoid swimming in areas like between houseboat pontoons, under swimming rafts, or where engine exhaust gases may have accumulated. CO can cause swimmers to lose consciousness and drown very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safe-use-of-propane-and-butane-">Safe use of propane and butane:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Propane and butane, like gasoline, are heavier than air and can easily accumulate in lower parts of the boat. These gases are highly explosive and can present serious dangers if not properly managed.<h4 id="safety-measures-">Safety Measures:</h4>
</li>
<li>Only use fuel-burning appliances (propane, butane, etc.) in well-ventilated areas.</li>
<li>Ensure gas cylinders are stored and used in well-ventilated spaces.</li>
<li>Secure all appliances to prevent gas leaks.</li>
<li>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation and operation.</li>
<li>Inspect all open-flame appliances regularly to ensure that they are in good condition and have no gas leaks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fuel-safety-precautions-and-ignition-protection">Fuel safety precautions and ignition protection</h2>
<h4 id="the-law-refueling-safety-procedures-">The Law: Refueling Safety Procedures:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the boat is properly moored to prevent it from moving during the refueling process, which could lead to spillage.</li>
<li>Turn off the engines before beginning the refueling process to eliminate any chance of ignition.</li>
<li>Clear the area by ensuring that only those directly involved in refueling remain on the vessel. This reduces the risk of accidents or distractions.</li>
<li>Turn off any stoves, heaters, or other open flames on the vessel to prevent sparks or heat sources that could ignite fuel vapours.</li>
<li>Do not allow smoking in or near the refueling area. A lit cigarette could easily ignite vapours.</li>
<li>Shut off all electrical equipment and avoid operating electrical devices during refueling, as sparks from switches or electrical equipment can ignite fuel vapours.</li>
<li>Seal the vessel by closing all openings to prevent fuel vapours from entering enclosed spaces and creating a dangerous atmosphere inside the cabin.</li>
<li>Never refill portable fuel tanks while they are on the vessel. Always move them ashore and fill them there to avoid the risk of vapour accumulation in the boat.</li>
<li>Avoid Fuel Tank Overfill: Overfilling increases the chance of spills and vapour leaks.</li>
<li>Prevent Sparks: Ground the fuel nozzle by first touching the side of the tank with your hand before inserting the nozzle. This helps to discharge any static electricity that could cause a spark.</li>
<li>Keep the nozzle grounded against the tank opening throughout the fueling process.</li>
<li>Before removing the nozzle, touch the tank again with your hand to prevent sparks when you pull it out.</li>
<li>Clean Up Any Spillage Immediately: If you spill any fuel during the refueling process, clean it up immediately. Spilled fuel is not only wasteful but also a significant safety hazard.</li>
<li>Run the ventilation blower for at least four minutes before starting a cold engine and before restarting a hot engine. This helps to clear any fuel vapours in the engine compartment, which could ignite when the engine starts.</li>
<li>Check for fuel odours by sniffing the air around the engine and fuel compartment. If you detect any vapours or smells of fuel, do not start the engine until the area is properly ventilated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blower-system-">Blower System:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The blower must be operated for at least four minutes before starting the engine. This is to ensure the air in the engine compartment has been ventilated and the fuel vapours are diluted to below explosive levels (i.e., less than 1.4% concentration).</li>
<li>The blower must meet the Construction Standards for Small Vessels to be deemed effective.<h4 id="underway-ventilation-system-">Underway Ventilation System:</h4>
</li>
<li>This system works while the vessel is moving and ventilates the engine compartment without the need for the blower.</li>
<li>Ensure that this system is functional and complies with the necessary construction standards.<h4 id="engine-start-and-monitoring">Engine Start and Monitoring</h4>
Warming Up the Engine:</li>
<li>After starting the engine, allow it to warm up to operating temperature.</li>
<li>While waiting, perform some important checks, including:<ul>
<li>Bilge pump: Ensure the bilge is not holding water that could cause instability.</li>
<li>Fuel Gauge: Verify that you have enough fuel for your trip.</li>
<li>Water Temperature Gauge: Check the coolant temperature to ensure the engine is not overheating.</li>
<li>Voltmeter: Ensure the battery is charging properly.</li>
<li>Oil Pressure Gauge: Verify that the oil pressure is normal. Low oil pressure could cause engine damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ignition-protection-">Ignition Protection:</h3>
<h4 id="ignition-protected-electrical-devices-">Ignition-Protected Electrical Devices:</h4>
<ul>
<li>All gasoline-powered vessels or vessels with propane appliances must have ignition-protected electrical devices. These devices are designed to prevent sparks from escaping, which could ignite the fuel vapours in the engine compartment.</li>
<li>These devices use seals and flame arrestors to ensure that sparks do not escape during normal operation.</li>
<li>Check for labelling: All ignition-protected components should be clearly labelled as &quot;Ignition Protected.&quot;</li>
<li>Inspection of Older or Refitted Engines:<ul>
<li>Many older vessels or those with refitted engines might not have ignition-protected electrical components (e.g., car or truck engines). These types of engines are not suitable for use in vessels with gasoline engines or propane appliances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a certified marine technician inspect your vessel&#39;s engine to ensure that it meets the ignition protection requirements. A technician can also assess whether any repairs or parts replacements might have compromised the engine’s ignition protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only use ignition-protected electrical devices on gasoline-powered or propane-equipped boats. Regularly inspect the engine to confirm that the ignition protection is intact, especially if the engine is older or has been refitted.</p>

          <h2>Review: Safety</h2>
          <h3>Small vessel regulations - Compliance notice</h3>
          <p>The Small Vessel Regulations apply to all boaters operating on Canadian waters. These regulations are important to ensure safety and compliance when operating any recreational vessel.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Loading Limits: The regulations outline the maximum load a vessel can carry, including passengers, fuel, and cargo. This ensures the vessel is not overloaded and can operate safely.</li>
            <li>Power Limits: The regulations specify the maximum engine power that a vessel can safely use based on its design. This prevents over-powering the vessel, which can lead to stability issues or unsafe operation.</li>
            <li>Licensing and Registration Requirements: These rules specify the requirements for registering and licensing a vessel. This is necessary to operate legally on Canadian waters.</li>
            <li>Mandatory Safety Equipment: The regulations list the essential safety equipment that must be on board, such as life jackets, fire extinguishers, and distress signals. Having the required equipment is crucial for the safety of everyone aboard.</li>
            <li>Safety Precautions: The regulations outline various safety precautions that must be taken while operating a pleasure craft. This includes operating at safe speeds, adhering to navigation rules, and taking care when embarking or disembarking.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Compliance Notice</h4>
          <p>A Compliance Notice is required by Transport Canada for any pleasure craft that is propelled (or designed to be propelled) by a motor. This notice must be permanently affixed to the hull of the vessel and is usually located on the stern (back) where it is easily visible to the operator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Recommended Gross Load Capacity:</strong> Maximum load the vessel can carry (including passengers, motor, fuel, and cargo). Maximum number of people (adult-sized) that the vessel can safely carry. Recommended engine power limit, if the vessel is designed for an outboard motor.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong> The operator of the vessel must not exceed the limits indicated on the Compliance Notice. This includes ensuring the vessel does not carry more weight than recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Important Notes:</strong> The load and power limits on the Compliance Notice assume the vessel will be operated in fair weather and the weight of people and equipment is evenly distributed to balance the hull. In adverse weather conditions, such as high winds or large waves, the load and power limits no longer apply. The vessel should be operated with a reduced load. Operators must account for weather and water conditions when planning trips.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Safety Equipment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In good working order</li>
            <li>Accessible and Available</li>
            <li>Maintained and replaced according to manufacturer’s instructions</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A PFD or lifejacket must be approved by one of the following agencies: Transport Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, The Canadian Coast Guard. If you are visiting Canada, you may also use flotation devices that conform to the laws of your home country, provided they meet the same standards for buoyancy and safety.</li>
            <li>Choosing the Right Flotation Device: Make sure it is appropriate for your size, weight, and boating activity. Bright colors like red, orange, and yellow are ideal for PFDs because they are the most visible in the water, aiding in search and rescue efforts. At the start of each boating season, test your PFD in the water to make sure it works effectively.</li>
            <li>Lifejackets: Designed to keep an unconscious person face-up in the water, even in cold water. SOLAS lifejackets are high-performance and approved for use on all vessels. Standard lifejackets are suitable for all vessels except those required to carry SOLAS lifejackets. Small vessel lifejackets are approved for small vessels (less than 6 meters in length). Inflatable lifejackets inflate automatically or manually when immersed in water, making them compact and comfortable when not inflated. Children under 16 are not allowed to wear inflatable lifejackets.</li>
            <li>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs): Designed to keep a conscious person’s chin out of the water. They are more suitable for active sports like water skiing or kayaking but do not provide the same level of support as lifejackets for unconscious individuals.</li>
            <li>How to Maintain Your PFD or Lifejacket: Avoid damage, clean with mild soapy solution, store in a dry, well-ventilated, and accessible area. The approved status lapses if it’s damaged, altered, or repaired.</li>
            <li>Keeping Children Safe: A PFD or lifejacket is not a substitute for adult supervision. Make sure the flotation device fits snugly, especially around the child’s shoulders. Look for a large collar for head support and to keep the child’s head above water.</li>
          </ul>

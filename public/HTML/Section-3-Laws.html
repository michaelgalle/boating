<h1 id="collision-regulations-rules-of-the-road-">Collision Regulations (Rules of the Road)</h1>
<p>When navigating on water, it&#39;s essential to understand the Collision Regulations (<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._1416/">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._1416/</a>), which are similar to road rules for cars. These regulations determine who has the right of way when two vessels cross paths.</p>
<h2 id="crossing-courses-">Crossing Courses:</h2>
<ul>
<li>When two vessels are on a crossing course, the &quot;stand-on vessel&quot; (the vessel with the right of way) maintains its course and speed, but with caution.</li>
<li>The &quot;give-way vessel&quot; must take early, clear, and substantial action to avoid collision by changing speed or course.</li>
<li>The stand-on vessel has the right of way and should not change course unless necessary.</li>
<li>The give-way vessel must take action to avoid collision, ensuring it passes well behind the stand-on vessel.
These regulations apply to all vessels, from small pleasure craft to large freighters, on any navigable Canadian waterway.<h4 id="penalties-for-non-compliance-">Penalties for Non-Compliance:</h4>
</li>
<li>Failure to follow the Collision Regulations can lead to fines, imprisonment, or both.<h2 id="vessel-sectors-">Vessel Sectors:</h2>
Think of the area around a vessel as divided into three sectors:</li>
<li>Port Sector (left side)</li>
<li>Starboard Sector (right side)</li>
<li>Stern Sector (behind the vessel)
These sectors help determine which vessel has the right of way in different situations. The goal of these rules is to prevent collisions and ensure safe navigation on the water.<h2 id="right-of-way">Right of way</h2>
<h4 id="power-driven-vessel-meets-power-driven-vessel-">Power-driven vessel meets power-driven vessel:</h4>
</li>
<li>If a power driven vessel crosses your path and approaches from your port side, you have right of way and are the stand-on vessel. </li>
<li>If another power-driven vessel approaches from your starboard side, then you are the give-way vessel (must take early and obvious action to avoid a collision). </li>
<li>If a power-driven vessel approaches from your stern, then you have the right of way and should take caution while continuing your course. </li>
<li>If a power driven vessel approaches directly in front of you, you should send a sound signal of 1 short blast, lasting approximately 1 second (which communicates that you are altering your course starboard, leaving the other vessel on your port side) and alter your course starboard.</li>
<li>When overtaking and approaching another power driven vessel from their stern, you must adjust your speed to decrease the magnitude of your wake and avoid capsizing a smaller vessel. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sail-driven-vessel-meets-sail-driven-vessel-">Sail-driven vessel meets sail-driven vessel:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Windward Side Definition: The windward side of a sail-driven vessel is opposite the side where the main sail is set, the side where the wind is coming from. For example, if the sail is set on the starboard side, the port side is the windward side.<h4 id="crossing-situations-">Crossing Situations:</h4>
<h5 id="vessel-a-port-windward-vs-vessel-b-starboard-windward-">Vessel A (Port Windward) vs Vessel B (Starboard Windward):</h5>
</li>
<li>The vessel with starboard windward has the right of way (stand-on vessel).<h5 id="both-vessels-have-the-same-windward-side-">Both Vessels Have the Same Windward Side:</h5>
</li>
<li>If both vessels have the same windward side, the vessel that is upwind (windward) must take action to keep well clear of the downwind (leeward) vessel.</li>
<li>Example: If Vessel A and Vessel B both have starboard as their windward side, but Vessel A is downwind, Vessel A is the give-way vessel.<h5 id="uncertainty-about-windward-side-">Uncertainty About Windward Side:</h5>
</li>
<li>If the downwind vessel is unsure whether the upwind vessel has the wind on its port or starboard side, the downwind vessel (with wind on its port side) must take early and substantial action to keep well clear of the upwind vessel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In crossing situations, the give-way vessel must stay well clear of the stand-on vessel, taking early, obvious and substantial action to avoid a collision.</p>
<h5 id="right-of-way-is-always-given-to-the-vessel-that-is-less-manoeuvrable-if-a-vessel-is-manoeuvrable-its-ability-to-alter-its-course-and-speed-is-not-impaired-">Right of way is always given to the vessel that is less manoeuvrable. (if a vessel is manoeuvrable, its ability to alter its course and speed is not impaired)</h5>
<h4 id="in-short-">In short,</h4>
<ul>
<li>Power driven vessels must give way to sail-driven vessels, vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre and vessels engaged in fishing with nets or trawls</li>
<li>Sail driven vessels must give way to vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre and vessels fishing with nets or trawls</li>
<li>Vessels engaged in fishing must give way to vessels not under command and vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="in-narrow-channels-">In narrow channels:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smaller vessels must give way to a vessel that is large and has difficulty manoeuvring</li>
<li>If there are dangerous currents, the down-river going vessel has right of way.</li>
<li>A vessel travelling through a narrow fairway/channel must stay as close to the edge of the channel/fairway on its starboard side as it can whilst travelling safely. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="navigating-in-or-near-commercial-shipping-channels">Navigating in or near Commercial Shipping Channels</h4>
<ul>
<li>When operating near commercial shipping channels or inshore traffic zones, smaller vessels and fishing boats should take extra caution. These areas are primarily used by larger, less maneuverable ships, so safety measures are crucial.</li>
<li>Always follow right-of-way rules and keep a safe distance from larger vessels.</li>
<li>Do not obstruct the shipping channel or moor to navigational buoys.</li>
<li>Ensure you are visible to larger vessels. Consider using a radar reflector to help larger ships detect your presence on their radar screens.</li>
<li>Carry marine charts for the area you are navigating to ensure you are aware of the shipping lanes and any potential hazards.</li>
<li>If possible, navigate with other small boats to make your group more visible to larger vessels.</li>
<li>Vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft.) in length must give way to vessels that can only safely navigate in a narrow channel or are following a traffic lane, regardless of course.</li>
<li>Always keep clear of docked ferries, ferries in transit, and vessels being towed. Ferries often use a prolonged horn blast (4-6 seconds) when leaving the dock.</li>
<li>Ferries may be anchored by cables, which could be submerged. Be cautious when crossing between a ferry and its dock to avoid hitting these cables, which could disable your motor or trap your boat.<h4 id="rules-of-the-collision-regulations-">Rules of the Collision Regulations:</h4>
</li>
<li>Rule 10: Always yield to any vessel whose maneuverability is restricted due to its draft.</li>
<li>Rule 16: If directed by a larger vessel to give way (typically signaled by five short-blast sounds), always do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these guidelines, you help ensure safety for both yourself and larger vessels in busy commercial zones. Always remain alert, and remember that small vessels are expected to prioritize safety and yield to more constrained, larger ships.</p>
<h2 id="sound-signals-for-collision-avoidance">Sound signals for collision avoidance</h2>
<p>When to Use Sound Signals: In areas with limited visibility, such as fog, a combination of long and short blasts on a sound signaling device is required to alert other vessels to your presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proceed at a safe speed while sounding these signals to ensure you&#39;re heard.<h5 id="departing-a-dock-">Departing a Dock:</h5>
To signal your departure from a dock, sound one prolonged blast on your sound signaling device (e.g., horn).<h5 id="maneuvering-signals-">Maneuvering Signals:</h5>
</li>
<li>One short blast: &quot;I am altering course to starboard.&quot;</li>
<li>Two short blasts: &quot;I am altering course to port.&quot;</li>
<li>Three short blasts: &quot;I am moving backwards (using astern propulsion).&quot;</li>
<li>Four short blasts: &quot;I am unable to maneuver.&quot;</li>
<li>Five short blasts: Used when the vessel operator doesn’t understand the intentions of another vessel.<h5 id="sound-signaling-device-requirements-">Sound Signaling Device Requirements:</h5>
</li>
<li>Vessels 12 metres (39 ft.) or more must have at least a whistle.</li>
<li>Vessels 20 metres (65.6 ft.) or more must have both a whistle and a bell.<h5 id="the-sound-signaling-device-must-have-an-audible-range-of-">The sound signaling device must have an audible range of:</h5>
</li>
<li>1.5 nautical miles for vessels under 20 meters.</li>
<li>1.0 nautical miles for vessels 20-75 meters.</li>
<li>Capable of producing a prolonged blast (4-6 seconds).<h5 id="vessels-less-than-12-metres-">Vessels Less Than 12 Metres:</h5>
</li>
<li>Can use hand-, mouth-, or power-operated sound signaling devices as long as they produce an efficient sound and can make a 4-6 second blast audible over 0.5 nautical miles.<h4 id="regulations-">Regulations:</h4>
</li>
<li>Sound signals are not just important for communication but also required by law in specific situations like crossing paths with other vessels or operating in fog or mist.</li>
<li>Non-compliance with sound signaling regulations can increase the risk of accidents and penalties.</li>

<h2 id="tips-for-protecting-canada-s-waters">Tips for protecting Canada’s Waters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep Your Bilge Clean — Avoid Polluting Waterways<ul>
<li>Never pump oily or contaminated bilge water overboard. Bilge water can contain fuel, lubricants, antifreeze, and other harmful chemicals. Instead, pump bilge water into a container and dispose of it properly onshore.</li>
<li>Use bilge sorbents (special absorbent materials) rather than detergents to clean your bilge. Dispose of used sorbents at a licensed facility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proper Sewage Management<ul>
<li>Do not pump sewage (black water) into harbours, shorelines, or confined waterways.</li>
<li>Vessels equipped with a toilet must have a holding tank to contain sewage until it can be properly disposed of onshore.</li>
<li>Follow all local and federal sewage disposal regulations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dispose of Garbage Responsibly<ul>
<li>Never throw garbage, especially plastic, overboard. Plastic debris harms aquatic wildlife and pollutes waterways.</li>
<li>Always bring your garbage ashore for proper disposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use Environmentally Friendly Cleaning Products<ul>
<li>Use biodegradable cleaners sparingly.</li>
<li>Avoid detergents containing phosphate as they promote harmful algae blooms that deplete oxygen in water and kill fish.</li>
<li>Prefer cleaning products that break down naturally in the environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refuelling Practices to Prevent Spills<ul>
<li>Insert the fuel nozzle fully into the tank to avoid spills.</li>
<li>Do not “top off” your tank after filling.</li>
<li>Clean up any spilled fuel immediately with absorbent materials—do not wash it into the water.</li>
<li>Use a funnel when topping up motor oil to prevent spills and wipe up any drips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use Approved Marine Paints<ul>
<li>Choose marine-approved paints for your boat hull.</li>
<li>Avoid or minimize the use of toxic anti-fouling paints.</li>
<li>Keep your hull waxed and clean regularly to reduce fouling.</li>
<li>Dispose of leftover paint and empty cans at toxic waste disposal centres, not in regular garbage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Minimize Wake and Propeller Wash<ul>
<li>Operate at reduced speeds near shorelines to prevent erosion, damage to property, and disturbance to wildlife and other water users.</li>
<li>Canadian regulations require boaters to moderate speed near shore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Report Pollution Incidents<ul>
<li>If you see pollution or evidence of pollution, report it promptly to Transport Canada or the Canadian Coast Guard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prevent the Spread of Invasive Species<ul>
<li>Inspect and remove plants and animals from your boat, trailer, anchor, and fishing gear before leaving any waterbody.</li>
<li>Drain water from the motor, bilge, and transom wells.</li>
<li>Never release live bait or aquatic animals into the water.</li>
<li>Rinse boats and equipment with fresh water.</li>
<li>Dry your boat and equipment for at least five days before moving to another body of water, as some invasive species can survive out of water for several days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

          <h2>Review: Laws</h2>
          <h3>Collision Regulations (Rules of the Road)</h3>
          <p>When navigating on water, it's essential to understand the Collision Regulations, which are similar to road rules for cars. These regulations determine who has the right of way when two vessels cross paths.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When two vessels are on a crossing course, the "stand-on vessel" (the vessel with the right of way) maintains its course and speed, but with caution. The "give-way vessel" must take early, clear, and substantial action to avoid collision by changing speed or course.</li>
            <li>Penalties for Non-Compliance: Failure to follow the Collision Regulations can lead to fines, imprisonment, or both.</li>
            <li>Vessel Sectors: The area around a vessel is divided into three sectors: Port (left), Starboard (right), and Stern (behind). These help determine right of way.</li>
            <li>Right of way: Power-driven vessels must give way to sail-driven vessels, vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre, and vessels engaged in fishing with nets or trawls. Sail-driven vessels must give way to vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre, and vessels fishing with nets or trawls. Vessels engaged in fishing must give way to vessels not under command and vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre.</li>
            <li>In narrow channels: Smaller vessels must give way to a vessel that is large and has difficulty manoeuvring. If there are dangerous currents, the down-river going vessel has right of way. A vessel travelling through a narrow fairway/channel must stay as close to the edge of the channel/fairway on its starboard side as it can whilst travelling safely.</li>
            <li>Navigating in or near Commercial Shipping Channels: Smaller vessels and fishing boats should take extra caution. Always follow right-of-way rules and keep a safe distance from larger vessels. Do not obstruct the shipping channel or moor to navigational buoys. Ensure you are visible to larger vessels. Carry marine charts for the area you are navigating. If possible, navigate with other small boats to make your group more visible. Vessels less than 20 meters must give way to vessels that can only safely navigate in a narrow channel or are following a traffic lane. Always keep clear of docked ferries, ferries in transit, and vessels being towed.</li>
            <li>Sound signals for collision avoidance: In areas with limited visibility, use a combination of long and short blasts on a sound signaling device to alert other vessels. Departing a dock: sound one prolonged blast. Maneuvering signals: One short blast (starboard), two short blasts (port), three short blasts (astern propulsion), four short blasts (unable to maneuver), five short blasts (uncertain intentions).</li>
            <li>Navigation lights: Sidelights (port: red, starboard: green), stern light (white), masthead light (white). These help determine right of way during nighttime and low visibility conditions.</li>

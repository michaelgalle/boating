          <h2>Section 1: Terminology</h2>
          <h3>Registration, Foreign residents, licensing, general terminology</h3>
          <h4>Registration</h4>
          <p>Registration is the formal process through which a vessel is officially recorded with the Government of Canada. This applies to commercial vessels and larger pleasure craft.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Who Needs to Register a Vessel?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Commercial vessels: All commercial vessels over 15 gross tons must be registered.</li>
                <li>Pleasure craft: Pleasure craft over 15 tons (if used for non-commercial purposes) must also be registered.</li>
                <li>Pleasure craft under 15 tons: These boats do not need to be registered; instead, they are licensed (described below).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Registration Process:</strong>
      <ol class="quiz-list">
                <li>Complete the Form 1 (Registration of a Vessel) for Transport Canada.</li>
                <li>Submit the form with supporting documents (proof of ownership, proof of origin, etc.).</li>
                <li>Pay registration fees (varies depending on vessel type).</li>
                <li>Upon approval, you’ll receive a registration number that must be displayed above the waterline in letters and numbers at least 10 cm in height on both the bow and stern. Inside the hull the registration number and tonnage must be visible. The stern must have both the name and port of registry displayed.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Registration is valid for 5 years. The Hull Identification Number (HIN) is required for registration purposes.</p>
          <h4>Foreign Residents</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>PCOC Requirement: Foreign residents must still obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) or other proof of competency if they want to operate a motorized vessel in Canadian waters for more than 45 days or that is licensed in Canada.</li>
            <li>Boat Registration: Foreign boaters can register their vessels in Canada, especially if they plan to use them in Canadian waters for extended periods.</li>
            <li>Temporary registration is available for up to 12 months.</li>
            <li>Boating Safety Laws: Foreign boaters must follow Canadian boating laws, including speed limits, restricted zones, required safety equipment (e.g., life jackets, fire extinguishers).</li>
            <li>Foreign Boating License (PCOC): Foreign residents can take an approved Canadian boating safety course and pass the test to obtain a PCOC. If you’re visiting Canada and operating a vessel temporarily, your home country’s boating certification might be valid (check with Transport Canada for reciprocity).</li>
            <li>Insurance: While not mandatory, it's highly recommended that foreign residents carry boating insurance when operating in Canada.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Licensing (PCOC)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Licensing is the process that applies to pleasure craft that are under 15 gross tons. These vessels do not need full registration and can instead be licensed with Transport Canada.</li>
            <li>Who Needs a PCOC? Motorized pleasure craft operators: All operators of motorized boats in Canadian waters must have a PCOC. This includes motorized boats, jet skis, personal watercraft, and similar vessels.</li>
            <li>Exceptions: Operators under 16: Operators who are under 16 years old can operate vessels with motors under 10 horsepower without a PCOC. Non-motorized vessels (e.g., canoes, kayaks) do not require a PCOC.</li>
            <li>Obtaining a PCOC: Complete an approved boating safety course (online or in-person). Pass a multiple-choice exam on topics like boating safety, navigation rules, equipment requirements, and emergency procedures. Receive your PCOC: Once you pass the exam, you receive a card that is valid for life. The PCOC is typically mailed to you (physical card or digital certificate).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>General Terminology</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Pleasure Craft: Any vessel used for recreational purposes. This includes powerboats, jet skis, personal watercraft (PWC), sailboats, etc.</li>
            <li>Vessel: A watercraft used for navigation or transportation on water, including pleasure craft, commercial vessels, etc.</li>
            <li>Operator: The person who is driving or controlling the vessel. This person is responsible for the safe operation of the boat.</li>
            <li>Hull Identification Number (HIN): A unique identification number assigned to each vessel at the time of manufacturing, similar to a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).</li>
            <li>Hull serial number: Must be displayed on the hull, and each character must be at least 3.2 cm in height and width. Used by police to recover stolen vessels. According to the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, no person shall alter, deface or remove a hull serial number.</li>
            <li>Commercial vessel: any vessel that is used to generate income</li>
            <li>Power-driven vessel: Uses machinery to operate and move. Requires a PCOC to operate power-driven pleasure craft.</li>
            <li>Sail driven vessel: Any vessel that is not using machinery to be propelled and is under sail. PCOC must be brought on board if the vessel is fitted with a motor, regardless of whether or not it is being used.</li>
            <li>PCOC: Pleasure Craft Operator Card—a boating license that proves the operator has completed a boating safety course and passed a test.</li>
            <li>Registration Number: The unique number assigned to registered vessels by Transport Canada.</li>
            <li>Licensing: The process that applies to pleasure craft under 15 gross tons. Instead of full registration, a licensing system allows the vessel to be identified.</li>
            <li>Right of Way: The boating rule that determines which vessel has the priority when vessels are approaching one another.</li>
            <li>Distress Signals: Methods used to signal for help in emergency situations (e.g., flares, horns, whistles).</li>
            <li>Lifejacket (Personal Flotation Device - PFD): A required safety device that must be worn by every person on board a vessel, unless certain exceptions apply.</li>
            <li>Restricted Zones: Areas where boating is either restricted or prohibited. These zones may include: No-wake zones, Wildlife protection areas, Docks and marinas</li>
            <li>Boating Safety Equipment: Essential gear for safe boating, including: Life jackets, Flares, Fire extinguishers, Throwable devices, First-aid kits</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Vessel terminology</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vessel:</strong> Any boat, ship, or craft designed, used, or capable of being used for navigation on, in, or through water. This includes vessels powered by various methods of propulsion, whether mechanical (e.g., engine), human-powered (e.g., oars), or sail-powered. (Legal Reference: Canada Shipping Act, 2001)</li>
            <li><strong>Hull:</strong> The main body of the vessel, running from the deck down to the bottom of the vessel. It is the outer shell and does not include components like equipment, fittings, motors, cabins, or bilges. The hull provides the structural integrity and flotation for the vessel.</li>
            <li><strong>Bow:</strong> The front end of a vessel. It is the part that typically faces forward while the boat is in motion. The bow is usually pointed or tapered to minimize resistance in the water.</li>
            <li><strong>Stern:</strong> The back end or aft portion of a vessel. It is the opposite of the bow and is where the propulsion system (e.g., engine or motor) is typically located. The stern is the last part of the vessel to pass through the water.</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="section2-safety">
          <h2>Section 2: Safety</h2>
          <h3>Small vessel regulations - Compliance notice</h3>
          <p>The Small Vessel Regulations apply to all boaters operating on Canadian waters. These regulations are important to ensure safety and compliance when operating any recreational vessel.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Loading Limits: The regulations outline the maximum load a vessel can carry, including passengers, fuel, and cargo. This ensures the vessel is not overloaded and can operate safely.</li>
            <li>Power Limits: The regulations specify the maximum engine power that a vessel can safely use based on its design. This prevents over-powering the vessel, which can lead to stability issues or unsafe operation.</li>
            <li>Licensing and Registration Requirements: These rules specify the requirements for registering and licensing a vessel. This is necessary to operate legally on Canadian waters.</li>
            <li>Mandatory Safety Equipment: The regulations list the essential safety equipment that must be on board, such as life jackets, fire extinguishers, and distress signals. Having the required equipment is crucial for the safety of everyone aboard.</li>
            <li>Safety Precautions: The regulations outline various safety precautions that must be taken while operating a pleasure craft. This includes operating at safe speeds, adhering to navigation rules, and taking care when embarking or disembarking.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Compliance Notice</h4>
          <p>A Compliance Notice is required by Transport Canada for any pleasure craft that is propelled (or designed to be propelled) by a motor. This notice must be permanently affixed to the hull of the vessel and is usually located on the stern (back) where it is easily visible to the operator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Recommended Gross Load Capacity:</strong> Maximum load the vessel can carry (including passengers, motor, fuel, and cargo). Maximum number of people (adult-sized) that the vessel can safely carry. Recommended engine power limit, if the vessel is designed for an outboard motor.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong> The operator of the vessel must not exceed the limits indicated on the Compliance Notice. This includes ensuring the vessel does not carry more weight than recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Important Notes:</strong> The load and power limits on the Compliance Notice assume the vessel will be operated in fair weather and the weight of people and equipment is evenly distributed to balance the hull. In adverse weather conditions, such as high winds or large waves, the load and power limits no longer apply. The vessel should be operated with a reduced load. Operators must account for weather and water conditions when planning trips.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Safety Equipment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In good working order</li>
            <li>Accessible and Available</li>
            <li>Maintained and replaced according to manufacturer’s instructions</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A PFD or lifejacket must be approved by one of the following agencies: Transport Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, The Canadian Coast Guard. If you are visiting Canada, you may also use flotation devices that conform to the laws of your home country, provided they meet the same standards for buoyancy and safety.</li>
            <li>Choosing the Right Flotation Device: Make sure it is appropriate for your size, weight, and boating activity. Bright colors like red, orange, and yellow are ideal for PFDs because they are the most visible in the water, aiding in search and rescue efforts. At the start of each boating season, test your PFD in the water to make sure it works effectively.</li>
            <li>Lifejackets: Designed to keep an unconscious person face-up in the water, even in cold water. SOLAS lifejackets are high-performance and approved for use on all vessels. Standard lifejackets are suitable for all vessels except those required to carry SOLAS lifejackets. Small vessel lifejackets are approved for small vessels (less than 6 meters in length). Inflatable lifejackets inflate automatically or manually when immersed in water, making them compact and comfortable when not inflated. Children under 16 are not allowed to wear inflatable lifejackets.</li>
            <li>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs): Designed to keep a conscious person’s chin out of the water. They are more suitable for active sports like water skiing or kayaking but do not provide the same level of support as lifejackets for unconscious individuals.</li>
            <li>How to Maintain Your PFD or Lifejacket: Avoid damage, clean with mild soapy solution, store in a dry, well-ventilated, and accessible area. The approved status lapses if it’s damaged, altered, or repaired.</li>
            <li>Keeping Children Safe: A PFD or lifejacket is not a substitute for adult supervision. Make sure the flotation device fits snugly, especially around the child’s shoulders. Look for a large collar for head support and to keep the child’s head above water.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Section 3: Laws</h2>
          <h3>Collision Regulations (Rules of the Road)</h3>
          <p>When navigating on water, it's essential to understand the Collision Regulations, which are similar to road rules for cars. These regulations determine who has the right of way when two vessels cross paths.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When two vessels are on a crossing course, the "stand-on vessel" (the vessel with the right of way) maintains its course and speed, but with caution. The "give-way vessel" must take early, clear, and substantial action to avoid collision by changing speed or course.</li>
            <li>Penalties for Non-Compliance: Failure to follow the Collision Regulations can lead to fines, imprisonment, or both.</li>
            <li>Vessel Sectors: The area around a vessel is divided into three sectors: Port (left), Starboard (right), and Stern (behind). These help determine right of way.</li>
            <li>Right of way: Power-driven vessels must give way to sail-driven vessels, vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre, and vessels engaged in fishing with nets or trawls. Sail-driven vessels must give way to vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre, and vessels fishing with nets or trawls. Vessels engaged in fishing must give way to vessels not under command and vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre.</li>
            <li>In narrow channels: Smaller vessels must give way to a vessel that is large and has difficulty manoeuvring. If there are dangerous currents, the down-river going vessel has right of way. A vessel travelling through a narrow fairway/channel must stay as close to the edge of the channel/fairway on its starboard side as it can whilst travelling safely.</li>
            <li>Navigating in or near Commercial Shipping Channels: Smaller vessels and fishing boats should take extra caution. Always follow right-of-way rules and keep a safe distance from larger vessels. Do not obstruct the shipping channel or moor to navigational buoys. Ensure you are visible to larger vessels. Carry marine charts for the area you are navigating. If possible, navigate with other small boats to make your group more visible. Vessels less than 20 meters must give way to vessels that can only safely navigate in a narrow channel or are following a traffic lane. Always keep clear of docked ferries, ferries in transit, and vessels being towed.</li>
            <li>Sound signals for collision avoidance: In areas with limited visibility, use a combination of long and short blasts on a sound signaling device to alert other vessels. Departing a dock: sound one prolonged blast. Maneuvering signals: One short blast (starboard), two short blasts (port), three short blasts (astern propulsion), four short blasts (unable to maneuver), five short blasts (uncertain intentions).</li>
            <li>Navigation lights: Sidelights (port: red, starboard: green), stern light (white), masthead light (white). These help determine right of way during nighttime and low visibility conditions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Section 4: Navigating the Waters</h2>
          <h3>Aids to Navigation</h3>
          <p>An aid to navigation is a structure in the surrounding environment of a vessel that indicates to the vessel important information, such as their position and course, any dangers or obstructions present in the water, or the main route.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buoys are the most common form of aid to navigation. They help boaters by marking specific points on water, like boundaries, channels, or hazards.</li>
            <li>Day Beacons are structures that are visible during the day and often have distinct shapes or colors to help mark safe routes or warn of hazards.</li>
            <li>Lighthouses are stationary structures with powerful lights that guide vessels through dangerous waters, particularly at night or in poor visibility conditions.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Lateral Buoy System and Standard Day Beacons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The Lateral Buoy System marks safe channels for vessels. It consists of buoys that help boaters navigate safely by indicating the left and right sides of a channel or the safest path through a body of water.</li>
            <li>Standard day beacons are fixed aids, attached to a structure permanently, and are only visible during the day because they are not lighted.</li>
            <li>Junction day beacons and junction (bifurcation) buoys are used to indicate the main channel at points where a channel divides.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Side Markers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Port-Hand (Left-Hand) Buoys:</strong> Color: Green. Shape: Flat top. Keep on the port (left) side when traveling upstream or towards a harbor. Light: Green. Identification: Odd-digit numbers and letters.</li>
            <li><strong>Starboard-Hand (Right-Hand) Buoys:</strong> Color: Red. Shape: Pointy top (cone-shaped). Keep on the starboard (right) side when traveling upstream or towards a harbor. Light: Red. Identification: Even-digit numbers and letters.</li>
            <li>Mnemonic: "Red, right, return"—when returning upstream, red buoys and day beacons should be on your right-hand (starboard) side.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Junction (Bifurcation) Buoys</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Port-Hand Bifurcation Buoy:</strong> Green with a red horizontal band. Keep on the left (port) side when traveling upstream.</li>
            <li><strong>Starboard-Hand Bifurcation Buoy:</strong> Red with a green horizontal band. Keep on the right (starboard) side when traveling upstream.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Range Day Beacons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Used to help a vessel stay on a safe course through a channel or into a harbor. Consist of two markers, one higher than the other, aligned to guide navigation.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Fairway Buoy</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Marks safe water, typically in the center of a shipping channel, at the entrance of a channel, or as a landfall marker. Color: Half red and half white vertically. Light: White, Morse Code "A".</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Isolated Danger Buoys</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Used to mark an isolated danger in the water, such as a rock, shoal, or wreck. Color: Black with a horizontal red band. Light: White, two flashes every 4 seconds.</li>

          <h2>Section 5: Pre-departure</h2>
          <h3>Before Heading Out</h3>
          <h4>Maintenance of vessel</h4>
          <p>Regular pre-season maintenance is key to avoiding mechanical breakdowns and ensuring your vessel operates safely and efficiently throughout the boating season. If your vessel operates for less than 25 hours per week, the following maintenance checklist is recommended:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drain Plug: Ensure that the vessel’s drain plug is properly installed before launching.</li>
            <li>Battery Maintenance: Charge the battery and confirm that it holds a charge for more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Fluid Levels: Top up fluid levels (engine oil, coolant, etc.) to ensure proper functioning.</li>
            <li>Lower Unit Oil: Replace the lower unit oil, especially if it wasn't done during the previous season’s postseason service.</li>
            <li>Fuel and Water Separation Filters: Check the fuel filter and water separation filter. Replace them if necessary.</li>
            <li>Boat Systems Check: Inspect all boat systems, including electrical, fuel, propulsion, and cooling systems.</li>
            <li>Wiring and Cable Check: Check wire and cable terminals for tightness, dirt, and corrosion.</li>
            <li>Throttle Connections: Confirm that throttle connections are secure and functional.</li>
            <li>Hoses and Lines: Check all hoses and lines for leaks or cracks and replace them if necessary.</li>
            <li>Flame Arrestor: For gasoline inboard engines, inspect and clean the flame arrestor with soap and water.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Routine Maintenance of Navigation Lights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Inspection Before Every Trip: Always confirm that navigation lights are in good working order before every boating trip.</li>
            <li>Spare Bulbs: Carry spare bulbs of the correct size and power to replace any burnt-out bulbs immediately.</li>
            <li>Gasket Maintenance: Inspect gaskets for proper placement, cracks, or splits. Replace if necessary. Spray gaskets with silicone to preserve them. Spray electrical connections with corrosion protector to extend their lifespan.</li>
            <li>Clean and Polish: Polish the lens, reflector, and light to maintain clarity and brightness.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Compliance with Rule 22 of the Collision Regulations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your navigation lights meet the minimum intensity requirements, based on the size of your vessel.</li>
            <li>For Vessels Less than 12m in Length: Masthead light: 2 miles; Sidelight: 1 mile; Stern light: 2 miles; Towing light: 2 miles; All-round lights: 2 miles.</li>
            <li>For Vessels 12m-50m in Length: Masthead light: 5 miles (unless the vessel is less than 20m, then 2 miles); Sidelight: 2 miles; Stern light: 2 miles; Towing light: 2 miles; All-round lights: 2 miles.</li>
            <li>For Partly Submerged Vessels or Towed Objects: All-round white light: 3 miles; Special flashing light: 2 miles; Blue flashing light: 2 miles.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Load capacity and distribution</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not overload the craft: Ensure that the total weight, including passengers and gear, does not exceed the vessel’s recommended safe load capacity or the maximum allowable number of adult persons.</li>
            <li>Distribute weight evenly: Position people and gear on board so that the weight is evenly distributed, ensuring stability.</li>
            <li>Keep the center of gravity low: Place heavier items in the lowest possible positions, ideally close to the boat's centerline, to improve stability.</li>
            <li>Secure gear: Lash down gear or stow it in lockers or under seats to prevent it from shifting. Unsecured items can become dangerous projectiles in rough conditions.</li>
            <li>Always adhere to the loading limits outlined on the Compliance Notice of your vessel. These limits are designed for fair weather conditions. In adverse weather conditions, the vessel’s carrying capacity is reduced.</li>
            <li>Overloading: A vessel that is overloaded is less stable and more prone to capsizing, especially if the center of gravity is too high.</li>
            <li>Overpowering: A vessel with too large an outboard motor will handle poorly and could be harder to control, increasing the risk of accidents.</li>
            <li>Keep the center of gravity low: Make sure heavy or bulky items are stored low in the vessel.</li>
            <li>Stow items properly: Gear should be stowed securely and out of the way to prevent creating tripping hazards.</li>
            <li>Ensure safety gear is accessible: Life jackets, fire extinguishers, and other safety equipment should be stored where they are easy to access but not in the way of movement.</li>
            <li>Safe Boarding Practices: Secure the vessel before anyone boards. Use solid handholds. Crouch low to maintain your center of gravity and avoid tipping. Board near the bow and then move to your seat along the centerline of the hull. Never step on the gunwale, as this can cause the boat to capsize.</li>

          <h2>Section 6: Operation</h2>
          <h3>Operating a vessel</h3>
          <h4>Departing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Push the vessel away from the dock before engaging the motor. Make sure the stern is at least 1 foot from the dock and the bow is angled away from the dock. Depart slowly, especially in shallow water, to avoid striking bottom with the propeller. Know the depth of the water where you're casting off.</li>
            <li>All passengers must be seated before the boat begins moving. Never sit on the bow, gunwales, stern, transom, or swim platform while the boat is in motion or the motor is running.</li>
            <li>Always check for people in the water before starting the engine. Never start the motor in gear. Always turn off the engine when someone is entering or exiting the boat, retrieving a person from the water, or anyone is near the stern. Never back up toward a person in the water.</li>
            <li>Assign a responsible adult to supervise children at all times.</li>
            <li>Boats don’t have brakes. You must be moving to steer. Always allow extra distance between your vessel and others. Use wide turns at low speeds—you need to turn the wheel more when going slow.</li>
            <li>Avoid marked swimming areas and known diving zones. Even small boats can seriously injure swimmers.</li>
            <li>Never “buzz” other boats, swimmers, or shoreline users. Never try to spray other vessels or people with your wake. Never jump the wakes of other boats. Never cross directly in front of other vessels. Never drive close to other boats or paddle craft.</li>
            <li>Keep well clear of swimmers, paddle craft, wildlife, and waterfront properties. Reduce your speed near others, in no-wake zones, and to minimize noise and wake. Minimize your wake to avoid eroding shorelines, disturbing wildlife, or swamping/capsizing smaller boats.</li>
            <li>Follow the Collision Regulations, especially regarding safe speed in different conditions. Know the local restrictions, such as speed limits, engine power limits, and no-wake or no-motor zones. Use courtesy and common sense at all times.</li>
            <li>Practice handling and turning at both low and high speeds. If you have a planing hull, learn the speed at which it planes. At low speeds, your hull plows through the water and makes large waves. When on plane, your wake is smaller—this is safer for the environment and other users. Adjust your trim so the hull tilts up about 3 degrees from horizontal for best performance and lowest wake.</li>
            <li>Recognize the Dive Flags: International Code Flag “A” (blue & white) means “I have a diver down. Keep well clear and proceed at slow speed.” Red & white diver flag is displayed on surface buoys marking active dive sites. If you see a diver flag or diving buoy, stay at least 100 metres away and maintain a slow speed. Keep a sharp lookout—divers may surface away from their buoy. Never assume the diver is directly beneath the flag or buoy—always proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>Every pleasure craft operator must maintain a constant and attentive lookout using sight and hearing, and use all available means (visual, auditory, radar, radio if equipped) to assess whether a risk of collision exists and act accordingly.</li>

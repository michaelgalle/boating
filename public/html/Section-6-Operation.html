  id="push-the-vessel-away-from-the-dock-before-engaging-the-motor-make-sure-"
>
  Push the vessel away from the dock before engaging the motor. Make sure:
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The stern is at least 1 foot (0.33 m) from the dock.</li>
  <li>The bow is angled away from the dock.</li>
  <li>
    Depart slowly, especially in shallow water, to avoid striking bottom with
    the propeller.
  </li>
  <li>
    Know the depth of the water where you&#39;re casting off.
    <h4 id="passenger-positioning">Passenger Positioning</h4>
  </li>
  <li>All passengers must be seated before the boat begins moving.</li>
  <li>
    Never sit on:
    <ul>
      <li>The bow</li>
      <li>Gunwales (sides)</li>
      <li>The stern</li>
      <li>The transom</li>
      <li>The swim platform</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    These areas are dangerous while the boat is in motion or the motor is
    running.
    <h4 id="propeller-motor-safety">Propeller &amp; Motor Safety</h4>
  </li>
  <li>Always check for people in the water before starting the engine.</li>
  <li>Never start the motor in gear.</li>
  <li>
    Always turn off the engine when:
    <ul>
      <li>Someone is entering or exiting the boat.</li>
      <li>Retrieving a person from the water.</li>
      <li>Anyone is near the stern.</li>
      <li>
        Never back up toward a person in the water.

    <h4 id="steering-collision-avoidance">
      Steering &amp; Collision Avoidance
    </h4>
  </li>
  <li>Boats don’t have brakes. You must be moving to steer.</li>
  <li>Always allow extra distance between your vessel and others.</li>
  <li>
    Use wide turns at low speeds—you need to turn the wheel more when going
    slow.
    <h4 id="stay-clear-of-swimming-zones">Stay Clear of Swimming Zones</h4>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid marked swimming areas and known diving zones.</li>
  <li>Even small boats can seriously injure swimmers.</li>
  <li>
    Sharing the water, lookout, safe speed (safe wake and wash)
    <h4 id="dangerous-behaviours-to-avoid">Dangerous Behaviours to Avoid</h4>
    Never:
  </li>
  <li>“Buzz” other boats, swimmers, or shoreline users.</li>
  <li>Try to spray other vessels or people with your wake.</li>
  <li>Jump the wakes of other boats.</li>
  <li>Cross directly in front of other vessels.</li>
  <li>
    Drive close to other boats or paddle craft. Misjudging speed or distance
    while performing these actions has caused some of the worst boating
    accidents.

<h3 id="navigational-conduct">Navigational Conduct</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Follow the Collision Regulations, especially regarding safe speed in
    different conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Know the local restrictions, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Speed limits</li>
      <li>Engine power limits</li>
      <li>No-wake or no-motor zones</li>
      <li>
        Use courtesy and common sense at all times.
        <h4 id="know-your-boat">Know Your Boat</h4>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Practice handling and turning at both low and high speeds.</li>
  <li>
    If you have a planing hull:
    <ul>
      <li>Learn the speed at which it planes (rises on top of the water).</li>
      <li>
        At low speeds, your hull plows through the water and makes large waves.
      </li>
      <li>
        When on plane, your wake is smaller—this is safer for the environment
        and other users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust your trim so the hull tilts up about 3 degrees from horizontal
        for best performance and lowest wake.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>Used on boats actively supporting a dive operation.</li>
    </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you see a diver flag or diving buoy:
    <ul>
      <li>Stay at least 100 metres away</li>
      <li>Maintain a slow speed</li>
      <li>Keep a sharp lookout — divers may surface away from their buoy</li>

    Additional Tips
    <ul>
      <li>
        Diving areas are often not marked on charts — if unfamiliar with an
        area, ask locals about popular dive spots.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rules 18 &amp; 27 of the Collision Regulations require all vessels to
        reduce speed and steer clear of boats displaying a “diver down” flag.

<ul>
  <li>
    When you’re out on the water, it’s important to regularly check the weather
    and confirm that conditions match what was forecast. Weather can change
    quickly, especially during summer thunderstorms, so staying alert helps you
    stay safe.
    <h4 id="signs-of-approaching-bad-weather">
      Signs of Approaching Bad Weather
    </h4>
  </li>
  <li>Darkening skies and rapidly changing cloud cover</li>
  <li>Falling barometric pressure</li>
  <li>Increasing wind speed</li>
  <li>
    Shifts in wind direction (which often lead to bigger waves) If you notice
    these signs, head for shore as soon as possible. Plan ahead by checking your
    charts to know where the closest safe shelter is.
    <h4 id="getting-weather-updates-onboard">
      Getting Weather Updates Onboard
    </h4>

      If you find yourself in heavy weather, such as a thunderstorm:
    </h5>
  </li>
  <li>Reduce your speed to maintain control of your vessel</li>
  <li>Head for the nearest safe shore you can reach</li>
  <li>
    Ensure everyone on board is wearing their Personal Flotation Device (PFD) or
    lifejacket

  <li>
    Turn your vessel to face into the wind to better manage waves
    <h5 id="handling-waves-in-heavy-weather">
      Handling Waves in Heavy Weather
    </h5>
  </li>
  <li>
    Try to keep your vessel on a course that minimizes the chance of waves
    washing onboard. Avoid traveling straight downwind if you can. If you must
    move downwind (for example, to reach shore):
  </li>
  <li>Don’t go directly downwind, especially if you have an open cockpit</li>
  <li>
    Instead, steer a zigzag path, crossing waves at about a 45-degree angle
  </li>
  <li>
    This helps prevent waves from hitting the stern (back) of the boat directly,
    which can cause flooding

<p>
  Boating safety is more than just having a well-maintained boat. Before
  venturing into a new area, always:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Study marine charts to identify potential underwater hazards (e.g., reefs,
    cables) and overhead obstacles (e.g., bridges).
  </li>
  <li>
    Consult supplementary publications like Sailing Directions, Tide Tables, and
    Atlases of Currents to understand water depths, tide times (high, slack,
    low), and current flows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gather as much local knowledge as possible about the area you plan to
    navigate. If marine charts are unavailable, ask experienced local boaters or
    residents about hazards such as low-head dams, rapids, or shoals. This is
    especially important for operators of small, unstable craft like canoes and
    sailboards, as hazards like strong currents and commercial shipping lanes
    pose significant risks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="common-local-water-hazards">Common Local Water Hazards</h3>
<h4 id="low-head-dams">Low-Head Dams</h4>
<p>
  Many inland waterways have low-head dams (usually less than 4 meters / 13 feet
  high) to maintain water depth upstream. Although small and seemingly harmless,
  these dams become extremely dangerous during high runoff periods (e.g., spring
  thaw or after heavy rains). Water flowing over the dam creates a powerful
  backwash at the base, generating a recirculating current that can trap and
  drown people or capsize boats. This hazard affects anyone approaching from
  upstream or downstream. Always stay well clear of low-head dams.
</p>
<h4 id="sudden-winds">Sudden Winds</h4>
<p>
  Certain valleys and mountainous areas can funnel wind, causing sudden powerful
  gusts that can easily overturn light boats. Be especially cautious when
  boating on mountain lakes or waters surrounded by steep hills.
</p>
<h4 id="shoals-shallow-areas-">Shoals (Shallow Areas)</h4>
<p>
  Shoals are shallow zones where boats risk running aground. They can be
  numerous and often unmarked by buoys, so always consult marine charts to
  identify their locations.
</p>
<h4 id="tides-and-currents">Tides and Currents</h4>
<p>
  In tidal areas such as estuaries, tides can drastically change water depth and
  affect navigation. Use tide tables to check times of high, slack, and low
  tides to avoid getting stranded. Currents can create hazardous conditions,
  especially where opposing currents or winds cause choppy, unpredictable waves.
</p>
<h4 id="rapids-and-strong-currents">Rapids and Strong Currents</h4>
<p>
  Rapids are fast-moving, shallow stretches of rivers or streams where steering
  is difficult. Standing waves in rapids can swamp or capsize boats, and
  submerged rocks pose collision risks. Avoid rapids and strong currents to
  maintain control and safety.
</p>
<h4 id="underwater-cables-and-pipelines">Underwater Cables and Pipelines</h4>
<p>
  Anchors can snag on underwater cables or pipelines, potentially causing the
  boat to capsize when trying to weigh anchor. Shore signs and marine charts
  typically mark these hazards. Always verify their locations before anchoring.
</p>
<h4 id="overhead-obstacles">Overhead Obstacles</h4>
<p>
  Obstacles such as power lines, cables, and bridges require careful navigation,
  especially for boats with tall masts or superstructures. Striking an overhead
  obstacle can cause serious damage or electrocution. Always ensure sufficient
  clearance before passing under such hazards.
</p>
<h4 id="rapid-build-up-of-high-wave-conditions">
  Rapid Build-Up of High Wave Conditions
</h4>
<p>
  When waves move from deep to suddenly shallow water, their height can increase
  rapidly, especially with wind. This phenomenon is common on Canadian
  coastlines and large lakes and can be dangerous near shorelines during storms.
</p>
<h4 id="floating-debris-after-heavy-rain-or-water-rise">
  Floating Debris After Heavy Rain or Water Rise
</h4>
<p>
  After heavy rains or rising streams, floating debris such as logs, lumber, and
  deadheads can be carried into waterways. Always watch carefully for these
  obstacles, which can damage boats or cause accidents.

<h2 id="anchoring">Anchoring</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Anchoring is a vital safety measure used to secure your vessel near shore
    during bad weather or if your craft is disabled. Proper anchoring prevents
    drifting into dangerous areas and helps keep everyone on board safe.
    <h3 id="choosing-the-right-anchor-and-equipment">
      Choosing the Right Anchor and Equipment
    </h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    Anchor Type and Size: Select an anchor and cable fittings suited to your
    vessel’s size, the bottom conditions, and the expected wind and wave forces.
    Using an undersized anchor or cable risks dragging, which can cause your
    boat to drift—especially dangerous if people are asleep or swimming nearby.
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiple Anchors Recommended: Carry at least two types of anchors, including
    one large enough for adverse weather.
  </li>
  <li>
    Anchor Line Length (Rode): The Small Vessel Regulations specify minimum
    lengths:
    <ul>
      <li>Up to 9 metres: at least 15 metres of chain, cable, or rope</li>
      <li>Over 9 up to 12 metres: at least 30 metres</li>
      <li>Over 12 metres: at least 50 metres</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Secure Fittings: Ensure the shackle pin has a locking device, properly
    secured.
  </li>

  <h3 id="preparing-to-anchor">Preparing to Anchor</h3>
  
  <li>
    Check Water Depth: Verify there is enough depth for your hull to clear the
    bottom and enough scope in the anchor line, considering tide changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Swing Room: Ensure the anchorage allows your boat to swing safely if the
    wind direction changes.
    <h4
      id="scope-ratio-scope-is-the-ratio-of-anchor-rode-length-to-water-depth-"
    >
      Scope Ratio: Scope is the ratio of anchor rode length to water depth.
    </h4>
  </li>
  <li>Calm conditions or overnight stays: 6:1 scope ratio</li>
  <li>Windy/wave conditions: 8:1 scope ratio</li>
  <li>
    Storm conditions: 10:1 scope ratio
    <h5
      id="attachment-confirm-one-end-of-the-anchor-line-is-securely-attached-to-the-vessel-and-the-other-end-to-the-anchor-before-deployment-"
    >
      Attachment: Confirm one end of the anchor line is securely attached to the
      vessel and the other end to the anchor before deployment.
    </h5>
    <h5
      id="deployment-lower-the-anchor-slowly-from-the-bow-do-not-throw-it-overboard-"
    >
      Deployment: Lower the anchor slowly from the bow (do not throw it
      overboard).
    </h5>
  </li>
  <li>Pay out at least six times the depth in anchor rode.</li>
  <li>Tie off the line on a cleat.</li>
  <li>
    Reverse the boat slowly until the anchor line tightens, indicating the
    anchor is set.
    <h3 id="common-types-of-anchors-and-their-uses">
      Common Types of Anchors and Their Uses
    </h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    Lightweight (Danforth): Two long flukes, lightweight with strong holding
    power; best for sand, gravel, or mud. Not good for rocky or grassy bottoms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mushroom: Heavy, permanent mooring anchors; not practical for recreational
    boats.
  </li>
  <li>
    Grapnel: Small anchors with multiple arms; good for rocky bottoms, poor
    holding in mud/sand/gravel. Common for canoes or very small boats.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kedge (Navy): Traditional style, heavy and large; works well in grassy or
    rocky areas, mostly for large vessels.
  </li>
  <li>
    Claw (Bruce): Single fluke with curved shape; holds well in sand, rock, and
    mud, allows full circle swing without losing grip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plough: Popular for cruisers; good all-around holding in sand, rock, mud,
    clay, and grass; resets easily.
    <h3 id="safety-reminders">Safety Reminders</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    Never set an anchor over the side or stern of a boat under 6 metres (20 ft),
    as waves can swamp the vessel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use an anchor chain between the anchor and rope line; the chain’s weight
    helps the anchor set firmly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider using a kellet — a weight attached partway down the anchor line to
    keep the rode’s angle low, improving anchor holding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Always monitor your anchor for dragging, especially during overnight stays
    or poor weather.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adapt your anchor type and size to the bottom type and weather conditions
    you expect to encounter.
  </li>

  Alcohol and Boating: The Risks and Legal Consequences
</h3>
<p>
  Never consume alcohol or drugs before or while operating a pleasure craft.
  Canadian law treats impaired boating the same as impaired driving on land.
  Under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to operate a boat with a
  blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over 0.08% (80 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of
  blood). Penalties for impaired boating are the same as for impaired driving.

  The Danger of Alcohol on the Water
</h3>

  combination significantly increases the risk of accidents, injuries, and
  fatalities. Operating a boat under the influence is as dangerous and illegal
  as driving a car while intoxicated. You could also lose your driver’s license
  if caught impaired while operating any motorized vehicle, including boats,
  ATVs, or snowmobiles.

  Under the Small Vessel Regulations, all towing activities are governed by the
  same rules that apply to water-skiing. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Barefoot skiing</li>
  <li>Tubing</li>
  <li>Knee boarding</li>
  <li>Wakeboarding</li>
  <li>
    Parasailing
    <h3 id="requirements-">Requirements:</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    Spotter Required: A spotter must be on board at all times to watch the
    person being towed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Seating for Towed Persons: There must be a dedicated seat available for each
    person being towed. This ensures safe recovery if needed. For personal
    watercraft, only those designed to carry three or more people may tow
    someone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Towing Time Restrictions: Towing is prohibited from one hour after sunset
    until sunrise.
  </li>
  <li>
    No Remote Control: Vessels towing water skiers or others cannot be remotely
    controlled.
    <h4 id="communication-and-safety-">Communication and Safety:</h4>
  </li>
  <li>
    Water skiers must be able to communicate with the towboat operator using
    standard hand signals.

    The boat operator must know these signals and ensure both the skier and
    spotter understand them.
    <h4 id="standard-hand-signals-for-water-skiers-">
      Standard Hand Signals for Water Skiers:
    </h4>
  </li>
  <li>
    Effective communication between the skier, spotter, and operator is
    essential for safety. Water skiers use the following standard hand signals
    to convey their intentions:
    <ul>
      <li>Raised hand with open palm: Stop or &quot;Slow down&quot;</li>
      <li>Raised clenched fist: Speed up</li>
      <li>Arm extended straight out, waving: Turn left</li>
      <li>Arm extended straight out, waving on the right side: Turn right</li>
      <li>
        Both hands raised above head: Fall or emergency — stop towing
        immediately
      </li>

  <h3>Operating a vessel</h3>
  <h4>Departing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Push the vessel away from the dock before engaging the motor. Make sure
      the stern is at least 1 foot from the dock and the bow is angled away from
      the dock. Depart slowly, especially in shallow water, to avoid striking
      bottom with the propeller. Know the depth of the water where you're
      casting off.
    </li>
    <li>
      All passengers must be seated before the boat begins moving. Never sit on
      the bow, gunwales, stern, transom, or swim platform while the boat is in
      motion or the motor is running.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always check for people in the water before starting the engine. Never
      start the motor in gear. Always turn off the engine when someone is
      entering or exiting the boat, retrieving a person from the water, or
      anyone is near the stern. Never back up toward a person in the water.
    </li>
    <li>Assign a responsible adult to supervise children at all times.</li>
    <li>
      Boats don’t have brakes. You must be moving to steer. Always allow extra
      distance between your vessel and others. Use wide turns at low speeds—you
      need to turn the wheel more when going slow.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid marked swimming areas and known diving zones. Even small boats can
      seriously injure swimmers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Never “buzz” other boats, swimmers, or shoreline users. Never try to spray
      other vessels or people with your wake. Never jump the wakes of other
      boats. Never cross directly in front of other vessels. Never drive close
      to other boats or paddle craft.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep well clear of swimmers, paddle craft, wildlife, and waterfront
      properties. Reduce your speed near others, in no-wake zones, and to
      minimize noise and wake. Minimize your wake to avoid eroding shorelines,
      disturbing wildlife, or swamping/capsizing smaller boats.
    </li>
    <li>
      Follow the Collision Regulations, especially regarding safe speed in
      different conditions. Know the local restrictions, such as speed limits,
      engine power limits, and no-wake or no-motor zones. Use courtesy and
      common sense at all times.
    </li>
    <li>
      Practice handling and turning at both low and high speeds. If you have a
      planing hull, learn the speed at which it planes. At low speeds, your hull
      plows through the water and makes large waves. When on plane, your wake is
      smaller—this is safer for the environment and other users. Adjust your
      trim so the hull tilts up about 3 degrees from horizontal for best
      performance and lowest wake.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recognize the Dive Flags: International Code Flag “A” (blue & white) means
      “I have a diver down. Keep well clear and proceed at slow speed.” Red &
      white diver flag is displayed on surface buoys marking active dive sites.
      If you see a diver flag or diving buoy, stay at least 100 metres away and
      maintain a slow speed. Keep a sharp lookout—divers may surface away from
      their buoy. Never assume the diver is directly beneath the flag or
      buoy—always proceed with caution.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every pleasure craft operator must maintain a constant and attentive
      lookout using sight and hearing, and use all available means (visual,
      auditory, radar, radio if equipped) to assess whether a risk of collision
      exists and act accordingly.

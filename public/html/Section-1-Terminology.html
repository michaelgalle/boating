    <h4 id="what-is-licensing-">What is Licensing?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Licensing is the process that applies to pleasure craft that are under 15 gross tons. These vessels do not need full registration and can instead be licensed with Transport Canada.
          Who Needs a PCOC?
          Motorized pleasure craft operators: All operators of motorized boats in Canadian waters must have a PCOC.
          This includes motorized boats, jet skis, personal watercraft, and similar vessels.
          Exceptions:
          Operators under 16: Operators who are under 16 years old can operate vessels with motors under 10 horsepower without a PCOC.
          Non-motorized vessels (e.g., canoes, kayaks) do not require a PCOC.

<li>Legal Note: Operating a vessel that is not seaworthy (e.g., overloaded or with an oversized engine) is considered a criminal offence.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="underway">Underway</h4>
<ul>
<li>Definition: A vessel is considered underway if it is afloat and free to move. It is not at anchor, not tied to a dock, and not on shore.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="windward">Windward</h4>
<ul>
<li>Definition: The direction upwind, or the direction from which the wind is blowing.</li>
<li>Windward Side of an Island: The side of the island that faces the wind.</li>

<h3>Registration, Foreign residents, licensing, general terminology</h3>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Registration is the formal process through which a vessel is officially recorded with the Government of Canada. This applies to commercial vessels and larger pleasure craft.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who Needs to Register a Vessel?</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Commercial vessels: All commercial vessels over 15 gross tons must be registered.</li>
    <li>Pleasure craft: Pleasure craft over 15 tons (if used for non-commercial purposes) must also be registered.</li>
    <li>Pleasure craft under 15 tons: These boats do not need to be registered; instead, they are licensed (described below).</li>
  </ul>
</li>

      />
      <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted">Figure: </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<li><strong>Registration Process:</strong>
<ol class="quiz-list">
    <li>Complete the Form 1 (Registration of a Vessel) for Transport Canada.</li>
    <li>Submit the form with supporting documents (proof of ownership, proof of origin, etc.).</li>
    <li>Pay registration fees (varies depending on vessel type).</li>
    <li>Upon approval, you’ll receive a registration number that must be displayed above the waterline in letters and numbers at least 10 cm in height on both the bow and stern. Inside the hull the registration number and tonnage must be visible. The stern must have both the name and port of registry displayed.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration is valid for 5 years. The Hull Identification Number (HIN) is required for registration purposes.</p>
<h4>Foreign Residents</h4>
<ul>
<li>PCOC Requirement: Foreign residents must still obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) or other proof of competency if they want to operate a motorized vessel in Canadian waters for more than 45 days or that is licensed in Canada.</li>
<li>Boat Registration: Foreign boaters can register their vessels in Canada, especially if they plan to use them in Canadian waters for extended periods.</li>
<li>Temporary registration is available for up to 12 months.</li>
<li>Boating Safety Laws: Foreign boaters must follow Canadian boating laws, including speed limits, restricted zones, required safety equipment (e.g., life jackets, fire extinguishers).</li>
<li>Foreign Boating License (PCOC): Foreign residents can take an approved Canadian boating safety course and pass the test to obtain a PCOC. If you’re visiting Canada and operating a vessel temporarily, your home country’s boating certification might be valid (check with Transport Canada for reciprocity).</li>
<li>Insurance: While not mandatory, it's highly recommended that foreign residents carry boating insurance when operating in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Licensing (PCOC)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Licensing is the process that applies to pleasure craft that are under 15 gross tons. These vessels do not need full registration and can instead be licensed with Transport Canada.</li>
<li>Who Needs a PCOC? Motorized pleasure craft operators: All operators of motorized boats in Canadian waters must have a PCOC. This includes motorized boats, jet skis, personal watercraft, and similar vessels.</li>
<li>Exceptions: Operators under 16: Operators who are under 16 years old can operate vessels with motors under 10 horsepower without a PCOC. Non-motorized vessels (e.g., canoes, kayaks) do not require a PCOC.</li>
<li>Obtaining a PCOC: Complete an approved boating safety course (online or in-person). Pass a multiple-choice exam on topics like boating safety, navigation rules, equipment requirements, and emergency procedures. Receive your PCOC: Once you pass the exam, you receive a card that is valid for life. The PCOC is typically mailed to you (physical card or digital certificate).</li>

<h4>General Terminology</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pleasure Craft: Any vessel used for recreational purposes. This includes powerboats, jet skis, personal watercraft (PWC), sailboats, etc.</li>
<li>Vessel: A watercraft used for navigation or transportation on water, including pleasure craft, commercial vessels, etc.</li>
<li>Operator: The person who is driving or controlling the vessel. This person is responsible for the safe operation of the boat.</li>
<li>Hull Identification Number (HIN): A unique identification number assigned to each vessel at the time of manufacturing, similar to a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).</li>
<li>Hull serial number: Must be displayed on the hull, and each character must be at least 3.2 cm in height and width. Used by police to recover stolen vessels. According to the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, no person shall alter, deface or remove a hull serial number.</li>
<li>Commercial vessel: any vessel that is used to generate income</li>
<li>Power-driven vessel: Uses machinery to operate and move. Requires a PCOC to operate power-driven pleasure craft.</li>
<li>Sail driven vessel: Any vessel that is not using machinery to be propelled and is under sail. PCOC must be brought on board if the vessel is fitted with a motor, regardless of whether or not it is being used.</li>
<li>PCOC: Pleasure Craft Operator Card—a boating license that proves the operator has completed a boating safety course and passed a test.</li>
<li>Registration Number: The unique number assigned to registered vessels by Transport Canada.</li>
<li>Licensing: The process that applies to pleasure craft under 15 gross tons. Instead of full registration, a licensing system allows the vessel to be identified.</li>
<li>Right of Way: The boating rule that determines which vessel has the priority when vessels are approaching one another.</li>
<li>Distress Signals: Methods used to signal for help in emergency situations (e.g., flares, horns, whistles).</li>
<li>Lifejacket (Personal Flotation Device - PFD): A required safety device that must be worn by every person on board a vessel, unless certain exceptions apply.</li>
<li>Restricted Zones: Areas where boating is either restricted or prohibited. These zones may include: No-wake zones, Wildlife protection areas, Docks and marinas</li>
<li>Boating Safety Equipment: Essential gear for safe boating, including: Life jackets, Flares, Fire extinguishers, Throwable devices, First-aid kits</li>
</ul>
<h4>Vessel terminology</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vessel:</strong> Any boat, ship, or craft designed, used, or capable of being used for navigation on, in, or through water. This includes vessels powered by various methods of propulsion, whether mechanical (e.g., engine), human-powered (e.g., oars), or sail-powered. (Legal Reference: Canada Shipping Act, 2001)</li>
<li><strong>Hull:</strong> The main body of the vessel, running from the deck down to the bottom of the vessel. It is the outer shell and does not include components like equipment, fittings, motors, cabins, or bilges. The hull provides the structural integrity and flotation for the vessel.</li>
<li><strong>Bow:</strong> The front end of a vessel. It is the part that typically faces forward while the boat is in motion. The bow is usually pointed or tapered to minimize resistance in the water.</li>
<li><strong>Stern:</strong> The back end or aft portion of a vessel. It is the opposite of the bow and is where the propulsion system (e.g., engine or motor) is typically located. The stern is the last part of the vessel to pass through the water.</li>
</ul>
